            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Some of the youthfuller ſort, would extoll to the skies their humanitie towardes ſtraungers, the delicacie of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, the beauty, pomp, &amp; daintines of their women, &amp; finally the infinite ſuperflutties of all pleaſure and delightes.</p>
            <p>Other of a grauer humor would dilate of the greatnes of their Empire, the grauitie of their prince, the maieſty of their Senate, the vnuiolablenes of their lawes, their zeale in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and laſtly their moderation, and equitie, wherewith they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne ſuch ſubiected prouinces as are vnder their dominion, binding them therby in a faſter bonde of obedience then all the cytadels, garriſons, or whatſoeuer other tyrannicall inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could euer haue brought them vnto. Theſe and ſuch like reportes haue from time to time kindled within me ſo greate a deſire to acquaint myſelfe with the particularities of this famous Cittie, that though during the time of my trauell, (deſtinate to more vnhappy courſes) I was not ſo fortunate as to bee a beholder of the glorie thereof, yet I haue not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from time to time to gather ſuch obſeruations as well by reading the beſt and choiceſt authors entreating there of, as alſo by conference with ſundry wel experienced gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as might not onely ſatiſfie the curioſitie of my own deſire, but alſo deliuer vnto other a cleare and exact knowledge of euery particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie worthy of note, that thereunto appartaineth, which cannot as I imagine (the nobleneſſe of the ſubiect conſidered) but bee <note place="margin">All other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gouern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within that of Venice.</note>pleaſing and agreeable to the beſt conceipted ſpirits, who may out of this one commonwelth of <hi>Venice,</hi> gather and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the fruite of all whatſoeuer other gouernments through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are of any ſame or excellency: for in the perſon of the Venetian prince, who ſitting at the helme of this citie ſhineth in all exterior ornamentes of royall dignitie;
<pb facs="tcp:9073:7"/>
(neuertheleſſe both he and his authority, being wholy ſubiected to the lawes) they may ſee a ſtraunge and vnuſuall forme of a moſt excellent Monarchie.</p>
            <p>Then what more perfect and liuely pattern of a well ordered Ariſtocraticall gouernment can there in the worlde bee expreſſed, then that of their Councell of Pregati or Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which being the onely chiefe and principall members of all ſupreame power; yet haue not any power, mean, or poſſibility at all to tyranize, or to peruert their Country lawes?</p>
            <p>Laſtly if they deſire to ſee a moſt rare and matchleſſe preſident of a Democraſie or popular eſtate, let them beholde their great Councell, conſiſting at the leaſt of <hi>3000.</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereupon the higheſt ſtrength and mightineſſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate abſolutely relyeth, notwithſtanding which number all thinges are ordered with ſo diuine a peaceablenes, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all tumult and confuſion, that it rather ſeemeth to bee an aſſembly of Angels, then of men.</p>
            <p>In fine, whitherſoeuer you turne your eyes, they ſhall not encounter any thing but obiectes of admiration; their iuſtice is pure and vncorrupted: their penall Lawes moſt vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably executed: their encouragements to vertue infinite: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by their diſtribution of offices &amp; dignities, which is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch ſo ſecrete, ſtrange, and intricate a ſort, that it vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerreacheth the ſubtiltie of all ambitious practiſes, neuer falling vpon any but vpon ſuch as are by the whole aſſembly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for men of greateſt wiſedome, vertue and integritie of life, as by the following diſcourſe moſt euidently ſhall appeare.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe before rehearſed, there are ſundry other ſo maruellous and miraculous conſiderations, and in their owne exceeding ſingularitie, beyond all reſemblance or compariſon with any other Commonwealth ſo vnſpeakeablie ſirange, that their wonderfull rareneſſe being verified, maketh the ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
<pb facs="tcp:9073:7"/>
impoſsibilities not ſeeme altogether incredible: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: first touching the ſituation thereof, what euer hath the worlde brought forth more monſtrouſly ſtrange, then that ſo great &amp; glorious a Citie ſhould bee ſeated in the middle of the ſea, eſpecially to ſee ſuch pallaces, monaſteries, temples, towers, turrets, &amp; pinacles reaching vp vnto the cloudes, founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Quagmires, and planted vppon ſuch vnfirme mooriſh and ſpungie foundations, there being neytherwood, nor ſtone, nor matter fit for building within tenne miles thereof, for ſo farre diſtant from it was the neareſt maine land, at ſuch time as the firſt foundation was laide?</p>
            <p>Beſides, what is there that can carrie a greater diſproportion with common rules of experience, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vnweaponed men in gownes ſhould with ſuch happineſſe of ſucceſſe giue direction &amp; law to many mightie and warlike armies both by ſea and land, and that a ſingle Citie vnwalled, and alone ſhould command &amp; ouer toppe mighty kingdomes, and ſuch famous farre extended prouinces, remayning euer it ſelfe inuincible, and long robed citizens to bee ſerued, yea and ſued vnto for entertainment by the greateſt princes &amp; peeres of <hi>Italy:</hi> amidſt which infinit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of glorie, and vnmeaſurable mightineſſe of power, of which there are in ſoueraignty pertakers aboue 3000. gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet is there not one among them to bee found that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to any greater appellation of honour, or higher tytle of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then to be called a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> including in the ſame the height of all imaginable honour, ſo deare vnto this generous people is the name and loue of their noble country?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, though not leaſt to be wondred at, they haue (as it were entertayning a league &amp; intelligence with the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers) preſerued this royall Citie of theirs this 13. hundred yeares ſince the firſt foundation thereof, in an eſtate ſo perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally flouriſhing &amp; vnblemiſhed, that though ſundry &amp; mighty
<pb facs="tcp:9073:8"/>
kinges and Emperours being enamored with her beauty and goodlineſſe, haue with maruellous endeuour and multitude of armies ſought to poſſeſſe themſelues of ſo faire and precious a pray: yet haue they hitherto kept her like a pure and vntouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed virgine, free from the taſte or violence of any forraine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement.</p>
            <p>The ſtrange beginning, mighty increaſe and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſſe of this happy commowea th hath ſerued to many preſent writers for the glorious ſubiect of their learned hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: among the reſt he that hath written thereof with greateſt iudgement &amp; authoritie in my opinion, is the Cardinal <hi>Gaſper Contareno,</hi> by birth a Gentleman, and by deſert and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at that time a Senator of <hi>Venice:</hi> but being now aboue foureſcore years ſince he wrote the ſame; ſince which time there haue ſucceeded many alterations of lawes, and changes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his country, I thought it not unneceſſarie to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ſundrie other particularities, gathered (as I ſaid) partly by conference, partly by reading of other learned Authors, as <hi>Donato, Iuſtinian, Munſter, Bodin, Ant, Stella, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouino, Domenico Franceſco, Girolamo Bardi</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contareno</hi> did firſt write this treatiſe in Latine, the ſame being ſince his time tranſlated into Italian by a Gentleman of <hi>Italie,</hi> which tranſlation I haue here chiefly followed, though ſtill comparing the ſame with the Latine originall, in regarde of my deſire to expreſſe the proper names of their Magiſtrates, lawes, and ceremonies according to their common appellations, which is much altered in the Latine ſtile: I will not ſpeake of my paines herein, nor enter into any inſinuating challenge of thankes, for in truth I haue neither taken the one, nor deſerued the other, hauing written it at idle times when I had nothing els to doe, being at much more leyſure then willingly I woulde bee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9073:8"/>
But me thinkes I heare it vbrayded vnto me, that it is now rather a time to doe then to write: I confeſſe it to be ſo for him that is well ſet on worke: and yet hee that writeth well is neuer the farther off from doing well: ſo that for my part I holde it no diſgrace to write ſo long as my penne vttereth no d ſhoneſtie. My education hath been in the wars: this I onely doc to beguile time; wiſhing that whoſoeuer ſhall herein cenſure mee amiſſe, would be as ready as my ſelfe, both in minde and body, when ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of my prince, or the occaſion of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſhalinioine me to other courſes: in the meanetime vtterly careleſſe of mine owne praiſe, I yet intreate them that ſhal reade this diſcourſe, to intertaine this famous Common wealth with all friendlineſſe and fauour, if in no other regarde, yet in this, that thereſt of the whole world honoreth her with the name of a Virgin, a name though in all places moſt ſacred &amp; venerable, yet in no place more dearely and religiouſly to bee reuerenced, then with us, who haue thence deriued our bleſſedneſſe, which I beſeech God may long continue among vs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Hauing oftentimes obſerued many ſtrangers, men wiſe &amp; learned, who arriuing newly at <hi>Venice,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <note place="margin">The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at their firſt ariuall at Venice.</note>the beautie and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence thereof, were ſtricken with ſo great an admiration and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they woulde, and that with open mouth confeſſe, neuer any thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime they had ſeene, to be thereunto comparable, either in glory or goodlineſſe. Yet was not euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſeſſed with the like wonder of one ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing: for to ſome it ſeemed a matter of infinit mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and ſcarcely credible to behold, ſo vnmeaſurable a <note place="margin">The cauſes of their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diuers.</note>quantity of all ſorts of marchandiſe to be brought out of all realmes and countries into this Citie, and hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be conueyed into ſo many ſtraunge and far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant nations, both by land and ſea. Others exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired the wonderful concourſe of ſtrange and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine people, yea of the fartheſt and the remoteſt nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as though the City of <hi>Venice</hi> onely were a common and generall market to the whole world. Others were aſtoniſhed at the greatneſſe of the empire thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, and the mightineſſe of their ſtate both by land and ſea: but the greater part of the moſt wiſe and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſort were rather in themſelues confounded with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement at the new and ſtrange manner of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Citie, ſo fitte and conuenient for all thinges,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9073:10"/>
that it ſeemed vnto them a thing rather framed by the hands of the immortall Gods, then any way by the arte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> induſtry, or inuention of men. And for this onely cauſe deemed the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> to excell all thoſe, that in this age are to be found, or at any time euer were. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether without reaſon, for ſurely if you looke into former ages, &amp; likewiſe into this wherein we liue, you ſhall hardly find any cittie comparable with this of ours, eyther for greatnes of Empire, frequencie of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or aboundance and magnificence of thinges.

Some in building of Cities, imagined they had well and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done, if they had choſen a place hard of acceſſe, or difficult for their enemies to beſiege or aſſault the ſame: whereby it commeth, that ſundry Citties are ſeated on the toppes of high hilles, with ſharpe and vneaſie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or elſe in mooriſh and fenniſh places: ſome again for other diuers reſpects haue imagined nothing to be preferred before an apt and commodious ſeate, fitte to conuoy in and out all ſuch thinges as appertaine to the making of a Cittie plentifull and magnificent, aſwell in matters of neceſſitie, as delicacie. Of which both points ioyntly you ſhall find few that haue beene carefull, few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that haue attempted it, but vnleſſe I be deceiued, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any one that hath in all points accompliſhed it.</p>
            <p>But the ſituation of <hi>Venice</hi> being rather to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome diuine prouidence, then to any humane induſtry, is (beyond the beliefe of all thoſe that haue not ſeene this cittie) not onely moſt ſafe and ſecure, both by land and ſea from all violence, but alſo in the higheſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9073:10"/>
degree opportune &amp; commodious to the aboundance of all thinges that are behoouefull to the citizens, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for traffique of all ſortes of marchandiſe, in manner with all nations of the worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſituation of the citie of Venice.</note> For it is ſeated in a remote and ſecrete place of the Adriatike ſea, where on that ſide (where the ſea behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the continent) there are mightie great lakes; fortified with an admirable artifice of nature. For twelue miles off from the continent, the ſea beginneth to be ſhallow: and among thoſe flats &amp; lakes there ariſeth vp a ſhore or banke like vnto a hill, which ſeruing as a fortreſſe againſt the waues &amp; violences of the ſea, maketh all the inwarde harbor (being very wide &amp; ſpacious) ſo ſecure, that not onely the vehemence of the ſea, when through the rage of any tempeſt it ariſeth, is repreſſed and kept backe, but alſo the ſhips that arriue, are debarred of free and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie entrance, in ſo much that if they be not of very light burthen, they are forced to caſt anker at the mouth of the paſſages or entries, and thence, when the weather is calme and quiet, being guided by skilfull pilots, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by certaine particular men experimented in thoſe ſhallowes and channels, they may at length come vnto the cittie by a narrow, crooked and intricate way, where the water is of greater depth, the ſame in a manner eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day altering and chaunging according to the tides of the ſea.</p>
            <p>The banke which ariſeth behind theſe ſhallowes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth almoſt threeſcore miles, and incloſeth the lakes within. Neuertheleſſe the ſame is not ſo entire, but that there is a rupture in ſeuen places thereof, which maketh an entry to the roade within, and it is ſix miles off from the Continent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9073:11"/>
In this manner therefore are the lakes of the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> incloſed, partly with firme ground, partly with <note place="margin">Ryalta.</note>this banke and ſhallowes: in middle of the which, in that place, which of our aunceſtors was called <hi>Rialta,</hi> and as yet retaineth the name, was the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> builded, at ſuch time as the <hi>Hunnes</hi> vnder the conduct <note place="margin">The cauſe of the firſt buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the City of Venice</note>of <hi>Atyla</hi> did ſpoile with fire and ſword the territory of <hi>Venetia,</hi> a noble prouince of <hi>Italie,</hi> which bordered vpon thoſe lakes: in which calamitous time the citizens of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi> of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> of <hi>VderZo,</hi> of <hi>Concordia,</hi> and of <hi>Altina,</hi> being all faire and goodly cities of <hi>Venetia,</hi> ſuch of them as were chiefe in riches, and nobility, did firſt get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their families into certaine Ilands, or rather little hilles, which did appeare out ſomewhat aboue the ſea, and there built them places of abode, in which as in a ſecure hauen they auoyded the ragefull tempeſt of the <hi>Hunnes.</hi>

It is manifeſt therefore, that the ſeat of this Citie muſt needes bee exceedingly ſecure, in regarde that the firſt building thereof was vndertaken by men, who to auoid the calamities of <hi>Italy,</hi> in midſt of ſo great a miſerie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there in moſt ſound and quiet ſafetie with their <note place="margin">Venice hath remained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched from the violence of any enemy ſince the firſt building there of, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeares.</note>families. But which is more, ſince thoſe times (which we haue not read hath happened to any other city) from the firſt building therof, euen vntil this time, being now a thouſand and one hundred yeares, it hath preſerued it ſelfe free and vntouched from the violence of any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, though being moſt opulent and furniſhed, aſwell of gold and ſiluer, as of all other thinges that might, yea euen from the fartheſt parts of the world allure the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bares</hi> to ſo rich a bootie and ſpoile. So that I doe not diſalow their opinion, that haue deemed the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> to excell and go beyond all other Cities. But yet there is one thing more in this citie, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my iudgement farre exceedeth all thoſe thinges, which wee haue ſpoken of, but likewiſe in all their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that do not account a Citie to bee the walles and houſes onely, but rather the aſſemblie and order of the citizens, chiefly and with greateſt worthineſſe to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that name, and this is the true reaſon, manner, &amp; forme of commonwealthes, through which men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a happie and quiet life: This is that rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, wherein <hi>Venice</hi> ſeemeth to ſhine, and to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all antiquitie, for though it is apparant that there hath beene many commonwealthes, which haue farre exceeded <hi>Venice</hi> as well in empire and greatneſſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as in militarie diſcipline and glory of the wars: yet hath there not beene any, that may bee paragond with this of ours, for inſtitutions &amp; lawes prudently decreed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9073:12"/>
to eſtabliſh vnto the inhabitantes a happie and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous felicitie, the proofe whereof is made manifeſt by the long continuance thereof in ſuch ſecurity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, which when I conſider with my ſelf, I am wont greatly to wonder at the wiſedome of our anceſtors, at their induſtry, the vertue of their minds, &amp; their incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue and charity towardes their country. There were in <hi>Athens, Lacedaemon</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſundry ſeaſons ſundry rare and vertuous men of excellent deſert, and ſingular pietie towardes their country, but ſo fewe, that being ouerruled by the multitude they were not able much to profite the ſame. But our aunceſtors, from whome wee haue receyued ſo flouriſhing a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, all in one did vnite themſelues in a conſenting <note place="margin">The nobility of Venice not ſo ambitious of their owne as of their countries ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note>deſire to eſtabliſh, honour, and amplifie their country, without hauing in a manner any the leaſt regarde of their owne priuate glorie or commodity. And this any man may eaſily coniecture, that the nobilitie of <hi>Venice</hi> was neuer ſo ambitious of any priuate matter pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to themſelues, as they were alwayes infinitely zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the honour, commodity and aduancement of their country, in regarde that there are in <hi>Venice</hi> to bee found none, or very few monuments of our aunceſtors, though both at home and abroad many things were by them gloriouſly atchieued, and they of paſſing and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deſart towards their countrie.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9073:12"/>
being prince of our commonwealth in the <hi>Genowes</hi> war, the greateſt and moſt dangerous that euer we endured, did not onely preſerue our countrey with his ſingular wiſedome, and maruellous greatneſſe of courage, but did ſo vtterly ouerthrow our enemies (they triumphing euen then as it were in an aſſured victory) that they in a manner were all eyther ſlaine or taken priſoners. Finally, hauing ſo mightily preſerued his country, and amplified and eſtabliſhed the commonwealth, hee paſſed out of this life, or dayning by teſtament, that on his ſepulcher (which at this day is to be ſeene in <hi>S. Stephens</hi> church) there ſhould not be placed any armes or enſignes of our familie: neither, which is more, is there ſo much as the name of ſo great a Duke engraued, but rather by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie is it come to paſſe, that the ſepulcher of ſo famous &amp; excellent a prince is in a manner vtterly vnknowen.</p>
            <p>I imagine this to be a moſt certain argument, that our aunceſtors delighted not in vaineglorie or ambition, but had only their intentiue care to the good of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and common profite. With this then exceeding vertue of mind did our aunceſtors plant and ſettle this ſuch a commonwealth, that ſince the memory of men, whoſoeuer ſhal go about to make compare between the ſame &amp; the nobleſt of the ancients, ſhal ſcarcely find any ſuch: but rather I dare affirme, that in the diſcourſes of thoſe great Philoſophers, which faſhioned &amp; forged co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths according to the deſires of the mind, there is not any to be founde ſo well fayned and framed, for which cauſe I thought I ſhould doe a thing very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſtrangers, if I ſhoulde deſcribe the order of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned a commonwealth: eſpecially becauſe in this time among the number of ſo many men learned, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9073:13"/>
of pregnant wits, ripe in the knowledge of all things, and excelling in eloquence, I ſee not any that hath vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this honorable taske. To which though I know the weakeneſſe of our ſtile cannot yeeld any ornament, yet the ſame is of it ſelfe ſo noble, that it is able not onely to yeeld dignitie to it ſelfe, but alſo to the vnworthineſſe of my ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Being therefore determined to write of this our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to the end that euery one may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame be well or ill diſpoſed, I thinke it beſt to take my beginning from hence.</p>
            <p>That man is by nature made a ciuile creature, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by himſelfe, neither able to liue well, not to liue at all, which euery daies neceſſitie, and the manner of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuailing and clothing approueth: and for this cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the beginning did men enter into ciuile ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therein continued to the ende, that ſo they might liue happily and commodiouſly, which is, that with mutuall helpe and diligence they might obtaine the chief good incident to men, ſo long as the courſe of this their mortal life endureth, wherunto the whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ciuil inſtitution pertaineth, that by the eaſieſt way <note place="margin">No life happy and bleſſed but that which contayneth in it the vſe of vertue.</note>poſſible the citizens may be made poſſeſſors of a happy life. But a life happie and bleſſed is ſo tearmed of great Philoſophers, the which containeth in it ſelfe the vſe of vertue, which they do approue with moſt aſſured rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and vndenyable arguments. Now the vſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue appeareth as well in the offices of warre, as in the functions of peace: which notwithſtanding though the praiſe of warre, and the manner of diſcipline thereunto belonging, be neceſſary to a Citie, for the preſeruation of the libertie and defence of the confines, and contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9073:13"/>
in it ſelfe great dignitie and goodlineſſe: yet the common ſence of men doth not allow theſe offices of warre (by which the ruine and ſlaughter of mankinde is procured) to be for themſelues deſired, and that all other ciuile offices ſhould be thereunto referred: for it were the token of an vnciuile diſpoſition, or rather of a man hating humanitie to wiſh for warres, ſlaughters, &amp; burnings, for this onely cauſe that he might be famous in matters of warre, and adde thereunto (if it pleaſe you) that he might be honored with the name of a great cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: wherefore all philoſophers of greateſt marke haue <note place="margin">Warre is to be deſired for the cauſe of peace.</note>in this one point agreed, that warre is to be deſired for the cauſe of peace, and that the whole function of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie vertue, and the commendation thereof ought to be referred to the offices of peace: wherefore that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of a commonwealth that would be accounted worthy of praiſe, &amp; (as the ſaying is) a man perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, ought to vſe that temperature, &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that order, that the whole commonwealth may ſeeme accommodated to vertue, and withall, that it bee rather thought to attend to the exerciſes of peace, then to the offices of warre, yet in the meane time not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning ſuch thinges as pertaine to the diſcipline of warres; becauſe many times the militare vertue (ſo that the ſame be vſed without iniurie) is neceſſary to defend and to enlarge the confines. But things being once or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as we haue ſaid, it is wont then to be doubted of, whether it bee better that one or few haue the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole citie, or rather the whole multitude, as many doe deſcribe the eſtate of that, which ought properly to be called a commonwealth. And truely to me it ſeemeth exceedingly well and wiſely ſaid of them,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9073:14"/>
the ſame being free from paſſion, which among many other the infinit bleſſings &amp; gifts of heauen, is not to be accounted in the loweſt, but rather the higheſt ranke, if we will truely conſider the vtilitie of lawes: for firſt in enacting them, many wiſe men meete together, who by long vſe growen skilfull in many things, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inuentions and examples of others with their owne experience, do at length after long conſultation determine that which ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto them, their minds being then directly bent to vertue, free from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, friendſhip, or other perturbation: the cauſe of no <note place="margin">The excellency of lawes.</note>priuate man being intereſſed in the eſtabliſhing of laws, which in courſes of mans iudgement often happeneth. But after that lawes once are enacted, if any then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe them, &amp; chaunce to ſuffer the puniſhments that they inflict, he cannot in reaſon blame any man, and in this caſe it is not to be feared that any ſedition or rancor growne among the citizens, being the greateſt &amp; moſt dangerous contagion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealths: whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe when any man is puniſhed by the iudgement of men not fortified with lawes, great &amp; grieuous enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do ſundry times enſue; for it ſcarcely can be choſen, but that we remaine ill affected towards him, of whom we haue receiued harme, ſo that I cannot well reſolue whether mankind be more beholding for any other <note place="margin">The inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of lawes was by the ancients, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated vnto the immortall Gods.</note>thing to nature the mother of all things, then it is for this inuention of lawes, which was of the ancients and not vnworthely conſecrated to the immortall Gods: but which ſerueth more meruailous, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ptince of philoſophers, in that booke of the world which he did dedicat to great <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> found not any thing to which he might likelier reſemble God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an autentike law
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9073:15"/>
in a Citie rightly gouerned: ſo that the opinion of this great philoſopher was in manner, that God was the ſame in the vniuerſity of things, as an ancient lawe in a ciuill company: and in his bookes wherein hee entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of a commonwealth, he tearmeth law to be a mind without appetite, which is to ſay pure, cleare, and free from the infirmitie of any paſſion, whereby any man, of how ſlow conceit ſoeuer, may perceiue the fitneſſe &amp; neceſſitie of that of which we ſpake before: that is, that ſomething more diuine then man ſhoulde rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the companies of men: for a man being aduanced to this office of gouernement, (as men endued with wiſedome, and integrity are rare) and they for the moſt part may erre in iudging and decerning things through the force of their affections, which do perturbe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the mind from her true courſe and intention, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of neceſſitie, that thinges cannot go ſo currant as they ſhould, yea though it might be ſo, that wee might find out a man ſo wiſe and vertuous, and of ſuch ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt conſtancic, that no perturbation were able to make his mind recoile from his duetie, yet neither on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were the rule of man to be wiſhed for before the gouernment of lawes: for he being of a mortall &amp; fraile nature could not long enioy that function, when lawes (as I ſaid) do in a manner concurre with eternitie. By theſe I thinke it ſufficiently perſuaded, that the ſouerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gouernment ſhould be recommended not to men but to lawes, to whoſe will yet ſome few thinges may be permitted, that are not well in lawes to bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: neuertheleſſe it is neceſſary, that there bee <note place="margin">A Gardian of the lawes.</note>made a certaine Gardian as Lieſtenant and miniſter of the laws, who may gouerne the commonwealth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

And becauſe all thoſe thinges that come into iudgement cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in lawes, that he then be an arbiter &amp; ruler of thoſe matters that are in queſtion: now againe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that controuerſie of conſtitution of lawes, which <note place="margin">Whether a few or the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be to bee preferred to the defence of of the lawes.</note>to ſome might ſeeme already decided, that is to ſay, whether one, or a few, or the whole multitude, be to be preferred to the defence of the lawes, &amp; to iudge thoſe things that do not fal into the comprehenſion of lawes. And though in the opinion of many men, the kingly domination is of higheſt eſteeme and greateſt account: neuertheleſſe I ſhoulde thinke that though the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie of one alone, that ſhould lawfully, and by right challenge to himſelfe the dignity of a king: if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be by it ſelfe conſidered, ſhoulde ſeeme of all other the beſt, yet in regarde of the breuitie of life, and mans fraile diſpoſition, which for the moſt parte enclineth to the worſer parte, the gouernment of the multitude is farre more conuenient to the aſſemblie of citizens, which experience the miſtreſſe of all thinges doth ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly teach vs, becauſe that wee haue not read that there was among auncientes any ſouerainty of a king, neyther haue wee in our time ſeene any that had not ſoone declyned into tiranny: on the contrary ſide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commonwealthes that haue continued proſperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many ages, and flouriſhed both in peace and warre, yet is the whole multitude of it ſelfe vnapt to gouerne, vnleſſe the ſame be in ſome ſort combined together; for <note place="margin">No ciuil ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety can remain perfect, vnleſſe the ſame be in a vnity contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>there cannot bee a multitude without the ſame bee in ſome vnitie contayned; ſo that the ciuill ſociety (which conſiſteth in a certaine vnity) will bee diſſolued, if the multitude become not one by ſome meane of reaſon, ſo

whoſe decrees and lawes aſwell the ſenate as all other <note place="margin">The great councell in which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fteth the whol authority of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Venice.</note>magiſtrates deriue their power and authority, is in that councell, into which all the gentlemen of the Citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once paſt the age of 25. yeares, are admitted: and ſundry of them not yet come to that age, ſo that they be full twentie, which priuiledge they obtaine by the benefite of lottes: of which hereafter we will diſcourſe the whole manner: Now firſt I am to yeeld you a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning how and with what wiſedome it was ordayned by our aunceſtors, that the common people ſhould not bee admitted into this company of citizens, in whoſe authority conſiſteth the whole power of the common wealth, then that this definition of citizens was not with leſſe wiſedome meaſured, rather by the nobility of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, then the greatnes of wealth, as in auncient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealthes it was wont, &amp; as many old philoſophers do preſcribe: for though the citie is the company of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: yet all thoſe men whoſe trauaile the Citie nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, yea and that dwell within the walles thereof, are not generally to bee reckoned in the number, nor regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the right of citizens: for euery citie ſtandeth in neede of artificers, and many mercenarie people, and hired ſeruants, of which none can bee truely tearmed a citizen: for a citizen is a free man, but thoſe are all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, eyther priuately or publikely: for mercenarie men <note place="margin">Mercenary men and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to be held as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſeruants.</note>&amp; artificers, are all to be accounted as publique ſeruants: for it is to bee beleeued that a liuing creature is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe made of nature, then it is needefull that the citie ſhould bee of men: for as in a liuing creature are many partes that haue no life, yet the creature needeth them towardes the maintenance of life: ſo in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of citizens, there is a neceſſary vſe of many men,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9073:17"/>
who neuertheleſſe ought neither to bee, nor to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or placed in the number of citizens: for which cauſe it was wiſely ordayned of our anceſtors, that the whole people ſhould not haue power in this commonwealth, which they deſired to faſhion in the higheſt degree of perfection. Becauſe many troubles &amp; popular tumults ariſe in thoſe citties, whoſe gouernment is ſwaied by the common people, which we haue alſo read, hath beene obſerued in ſundry commonwealthes, &amp; alſo deliuered in way of precept by many and great philoſophers, yet many were of contrarie opinion, deeming that it would doe well, if this manner of gouerning the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould rather bee defined by abilitie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches: but here againe they fell into great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities <note place="margin">The abſurdity of thoſe that elect the rulers &amp; magiſtrates of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their riches.</note>and no ſmall inconueniences: for it happeneth often that thoſe of the baſeſt ſort, yea of the very skum of the people, do ſcrape together great wealth, as thoſe that apply themſelues to filthy artes, and illiberall occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, neuer ſparing the toileſome and carefull wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of their liues, but with an intollerable ſauing, defrauding themſelues of the comforts of life, thereby to increaſe their ſubſtance. Contrariwiſe the honeſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and thoſe that are liberally brought vppe, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall to pouertie, either (as it often happeneth) by aduerſe fortune, or els that being wholly addicted to noble and liberall ſtudies, they neglect the increaſing of their wealth: whereby it commeth that filthy and ill mannerd men ſauouring of nothing but gaine, vtterly ignorant of good artes, by little and little come to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the commonwealth: and thoſe that are honeſt &amp; of liberall condition by the decay of their ſubſtance, do looſe the right of citizens, wherby of neceſſity there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9073:18"/>
muſt ariſe great ſeditions and troubles to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Therefore our wiſe and prudent anceſtors, leſt their commonwealth ſhould happen into theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ordered that this definition of the publike rule, <note place="margin">Nobility of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage to be in election of magiſtrates preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore riches.</note>ſhould go rather by the nobility of lineage, then by the eſtimation of wealth: yet with that temperature, that men of chiefe &amp; ſupreme nobilitie ſhould not haue this rule alone (for that wold rather haue been the power of a few then a commonwealth) but alſo euery other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen whoſoeuer not ignobly borne: ſo that all which were noble by birth, or enobled by vertue, or well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the commonwealth, did in the beginning ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this right of gouernment: which hath likewiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in theſe times of ours, yea and ſome forrain men and ſtrangers haue beene adopted into this number of <note place="margin">Strangers ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted into the right of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by the Venetians.</note>citizens, eyther in regard of their great nobility, or that they had beene dutifull towardes the ſtate, or els had done vnto them ſome notable ſeruice. This whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly therefore of the citizens (or as commonly it is termed) this great councell (vpon whoſe authority the whole power of this commonwealth, as alſo the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſenat and of all the magiſtrates dependeth) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth <note place="margin">The Duke ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth during life.</note>in this commonwealth the forme of a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtate. The Duke who hath no time of gouernment limited vnto him, but ruleth during life, beareth the ſhew of a kingly power, repreſenting in all thinges the glory, grauitie and dignity of a king: the reſt of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens do beare him honor and reuerence as vnto a king: &amp; all decrees, lawes, and publike letters go forth vnder his name. But the Senate, the tenne, the colledge of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or chiefe counſellors, which amongſt vs of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are commonly called the ſages: thoſe I ſay
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9073:18"/>
which do conſult of matters, &amp; after from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth do make report vnto the Senat, carry with them a certaine ſhew of an Ariſtocracy or gouernment of the nobilitie: which ſeeing they are the chiefe parts of this commonwealth, before we come to the meaner magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; we will ſpeake particularly of theſe. We wil take our beginning from the greater councell, vpon which the whole commonwealth dependeth.</p>
            <p>All yong men of the nobilitie, which haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed <note place="margin">Yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at 20. yeares of their age admitted to the great councell of Venice.</note>the age of 20. years, do go vnto the office which commonly is called aduocatory, to which the defence of the lawes chiefly belongeth: before which preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues with their father, or with their mother: if he be dead, or in caſe of both their wants, with ſome neere kinſeman, they doe proue with the witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of two honeſt men (neither of them being of the mothers kindred) themſelues to be borne of that father whom they alledge, not baſtards, but in lawfull matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, &amp; that their mother liued in fame of an honeſt woman. The witneſſes ſweare in this manner, that they do manifeſtly know it by the report and conſent of <note place="margin">An oath taken in the behalfe of the yong gentlemen before they are admitted into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note>al thoſe that know them. Then the father or the mother or (they both wanting) the kinſemen affirme with the oath, that the young man hath paſſed his 20. yeares: which thinges after they are directly regiſtred by the clearke of the office, they then attend the fourth day of the moneth of Decemb. on which day the names of all theſe yong men that haue not yet by lotte obtained the right of citizens, nor are not paſſed 25. years old, are put into a pot, and carried vnto the prince, &amp; there the ſame ſet before the counſellors, with which there is another pot, wherin are round balles equall with the number of the names write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the firſt, euery one hauing his marks;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9073:19"/>
the fift part of theſe balles is guilded with gold, the reſt with ſiluer: the prince taketh out of the firſt potte the name, and then out of the next potte the ball, which if he be of the golden ſort, the young man whoſe name was drawen, hath preſently the authority of publike power, and is admitted into the great counſaile, but if it be of the ſiluered, he leeſeth for that time his right, and expecteth his fortune of the yeare to come, vnleſſe in the meane time hee accompliſh the 25. yeare of his age: for euery gentleman comming to that age hath preſently the right of a citizen, and is made pertaker of the publike authoritie, by this meanes the fift part of the noble yong men, that put themſelues to this tryall, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeare admitted and enabled to giue his voyce with the other citizens: but if it ſo happen that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or grandfather of any gentleman, eyther in regard of abſence or other cauſe, had neuer vſed this publique right, nor his name neuer beene regiſtred in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon booke, that contayneth the names of all the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (leſt there ſhould be any fraud vſed, or leſt any ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſhoulde vnder hande enter into this company of <note place="margin">No baſtard admitted for noble.</note>gentlemen) they would not that this matter ſhould bee iudged and determined of onely by the office of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatory magiſtrates, but it is prouided for by a lawe, that they ſhould proue their nobilitie by witneſſes and publike writings, and that the aduocators ſhould make <note place="margin">The counſell of the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>report ouer to the forty men, and ſo the cauſe being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and throughly examined and debated of by the forty men, it is at length iudged whether the party pretending is to be admitted for noble or no.</p>
            <p>But to the end that no one ſhoulde ſcotfree aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the triall of this iudgement, it was alſo prouided,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9073:19"/>
that whoſoeuer ſhould vndertake this proofe of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, ſhoulde firſt bring vnto the magiſtrate fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crownes of gold, by them to be put into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in caſe the pretendant ſpeed not in his ſuit. Such was the diligence of our anceſtors, to the end that this congregation of nobility ſhould no way be defiled. For which cauſe thoſe very citizens which are nobly borne, and haue paſt their 25. yeares, obtaine not yet the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of giuing their voices, till being ſo preſented before the magiſtrates, they proue the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the age by the othe of their father, mother, or neere kinſeman, and alſo by two witneſſes, that they were born of that gentleman, who they ſay was their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not baſtards, nor of a mother any way reproched.</p>
            <p>Now that we haue expreſſed the whole manner by which the citizens do enter into the publike authoritie, I thinke it worthy to be marked, that our anceſtors did deeme it a thing of great moment for the maintenance of the citizens in vnitie and loue, if they did often meet and aſſemble together. Therefore as wel by lawes as by preſcription of time, it is an ancient cuſtome that this <note place="margin">The great cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled euery eight day.</note>great counſaile ſhould be aſſembled euery eight day, &amp; ſometimes oftner. The eſpeciall office of which is to create all the magiſtrates: aſwell thoſe that adminiſter iuſtice in the cittie, and inioy other offices in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as the ſenate, the tenne, the Pretors, the Captaines and treaſurers of caſtles and Citties, which are vnder the fellowſhip of the Venetian empire, as alſo the gouernors of ſortreſſes, the General of their nauie, their ambaſſadors, captaines of their gallies, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conclude all in a word, all thoſe whoſoeuer abroad or at home, haue charge vnder the commonwealth.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9073:20"/>
Likewiſe all ſuch lawes as pertain to the conſtitution of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, are enacted by the authority of this councell, which is eſpecially vſed to be done when the Duke is dead, there being no new ſucceſſor as yet crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But this ſhalbe ſpoken of more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now we wil expreſſe the whole manner of creating <note place="margin">The order of the Seſſion houſe.</note>magiſtrates. Euery holliday in manner about noone this great councell is aſſembled into a great and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Ten very long benches in the hall where the great councell is kept.</note>hall, which we will call the Seſſion houſe. There are in the ſame ten exceeding long benches, equalling in manner the length of the hall: the cittizens ſit downe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one when they come, where it pleaſeth them, for there is no place appointed to any, except to ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of chiefe authority, as the Duke, the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, &amp; the three preſidents of the fortie, which ſit on a higher ſeate, &amp; onely haue authoritie to make report o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the great Councell. After theſe the Aduocatory magiſtrates, and the three heads of the tenne ſit downe in their appointed places, in the midſt of certaine ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that are alſo ſomewhat higher then the reſt, &amp; are cloſe adioyning to the wall of the hall, &amp; at length very farre from the Duke are the ſeates of the olde and new auditors, of whom we will ſpeake more hereafter. But the reſt of the citizens (as I ſaid) ſit downe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place appointed where it pleaſeth them. Then at an appointed houre the dores of the Seſſion houſe are ſhut faſt, &amp; the keyes brought to the Tribunal of the prince, &amp; there laid at his feete. Then the chiefe Chauncellor (which though it be not an honor of the nobilitie, yet it is of very great dignity) ſtandeth vp, &amp; from a high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent place declareth what roomes and offices are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, &amp; then to be prouided for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9073:20"/>
he paſſeth ſtraight from that place to the Tribunal of the Prince, and there with a loude voyce citeth the Magiſtrates being Preſidentes of the ſeſſions (as is ſaide before) that they ſhould come to the Prince, or to the Counſellors if the prince be away. They being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned do preſently come, and there with oth do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do their vttermoſt diligence, that the lawes may be obſerued, and that they will not in theſe offices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any citizen, that ſhall any way haue violated the decrees, but that they will cauſe ſuch a one to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſhed, according to the rigor of the lawes: which ceremony being ended, euery one returneth to his place except one of the aduocators, and one of the heades of the tenne, which go to the fartheſt part of the hall right oppoſite againſt the princes ſeat, &amp; there ſitte downe in appointed places. The other aduocators ſitte downe on the right fide of the ſeſſion houſe: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heads of the tenne right ouer againſt them on the left ſide. In like manner doe the olde and new auditors place themſelues in the fartheſt ſeate of the hall (which as I ſaid, is far diſtant from the place of the prince) ſome on the right hand, &amp; ſome on the left, to the ende, as it ſhould ſeeme, that by this manner ſeating themſelues, they ſhould ſerue (as it were) for gards or watchmen to this great aſſembly, leaſt any thing ſhould there happen to be done vneſpied or vnpuniſhed, againſt the lawes or order of the Seſſions. The Magiſtrates then being in this manner placed, there are brought before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">The manner of chooſing their electors,</note>of the prince 3. pots, hauing in them little bals, ſome of gold, &amp; ſome of ſiluer: one of the which is placed in the middeſt of the Tribunall ſeate, and the other two at each ende one, in eyther of which there are infinite
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9073:21"/>
balles of ſiluer, but onely thirtie of golde, but in the middle potte, there are not aboue threeſcore balles in all, of which ſixe and thirtie are of gold, and the other foure and twentie of ſiluer, and the golden balles are all marked with certaine letters, which they bring forth euery ſeſſions by lot, leaſt otherwiſe there might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit vſed. The pottes being placed, three of the yongeſt counſellors ariſe from their ſeats, and ſit downe on the loweſt place of the Tribunall, by the three pottes, euerie counſellor by a ſeuerall pot. This being thus done and ordered, then that ranke of citizens, whoſe lot commeth forth, riſeth preſently on either parte of the ſeſſion houſe: for throughout the length of the hall, are placed tenne rankes of benches, in which (as I ſaid before) the citizens ſitte as pleaſeth them: to two of which rankes one lot onely ſerueth, that is to ſay, to thoſe that on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the hall are oppoſite one to the other. This ranke then whoſe lotte is drawen, is called by the cryer with a high voice, which ranke, and that which reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to it on the other ſide of the hall, preſently ariſeth, and the citizens in order as they ſate, go vnto thoſe pots which the counſellors haue charge of, neere vnto the princes ſeate, and each of them putting in his hande ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out a ball, which if it be of ſiluer, hee returneth by a contrarie way to the ſeate whence he came: if it be of gold, hee ſheweth it to the Counſellor, who hath the charge of that potte, to bee viewed if it bee of the right marke.</p>
            <p>This manner of marke was ordained, leaſt ſome one otherwiſe might bring with him a golden ball, which holding priuily in his hande, hee might ſeeme to haue drawne out of the potte, and ſo by fraude obtaine the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9073:21"/>
place of an Elector. Hee then to whoſe lotte befalleth one of theſe golden balles, goeth ſtraight to the middle potte, and draweth out another ball, which if it bee of filuer, hee returneth whence hee came, looſing for that time his voice of election: but if it be of gold he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth the Tribunal, and ſitteth downe on the princes ſide in a place appointed him. The ſeconde that ſhall haue the like lot goeth alſo to the ſame place, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the third, &amp; ſo the others vntill they be nine in all, which maketh complete the firſt number, who are in that ranke placed in order, without reſpect of any thing, ſaue onely of their age. Here it is not to be forgotten, that thoſe who by this benefite of lot are made electors, are preſently in a loud voyce proclaimed by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in ſuch ſorte, that the whole aſſembly heareth him: after which no one of his neere kinſemen or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance may by any meanes attempt this lot of making himſelfe Elector: neyther may there any more then two of one family be admitted to ſtand for the elector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe: which was with great wiſedome ordained of our aunceſtors, to the ende that this honour of election might ſtretch to many families, and this publike bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite be largely extended among the citizens, for of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ought to ſuffice if the lot fauouringtwo of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily make them pertakers of publique authority. But to returne from whence I haue digreſſed, ſo ſoone as this firſt number of the nine electors is complete, they <note place="margin">The manner of the choyce of magiſtrates made by the Electors.</note>go preſently out of the Seſſion houſe into a diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner roome, where alſo is preſent a Secretary of the commonwealth, who relateth to the Electors thoſe thinges that are by the lawes ordained, and what they are to obſerue in their election of Magiſtrates. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9073:22"/>
hee readeth vnto them the decrees of the ſenate, and other lawes, by which it is defended, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſhall not by any meanes ſuffer themſelues to bee bribed or corrupted with money, nor vſe in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction any fraude or deceipt. This being done the nine Electors are placed in ſeates, euery one according to his age, the eldeſt in the higheſt and worthieſt place: for the Venetians will not allow among their citizens any other difference, then only of age, becauſe from thence neuer ſprang any ſedition nor contention: neither is the ſame omitted of thoſe gret philoſophers. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (I ſay) in his Politiques, and <hi>Zenophon</hi> in that famous worke of his, of the inſtitution of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors thus placed, there are then nine little bals throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into a potte, each of them marked with his number from the firſt to the ninth: &amp; in a ſcroll ſomewhat long are written the magiſtracies in order that are in this ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be prouided for. The eldeſt of the electors firſt putteth in his hand into the pot, &amp; taketh out a ball, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number with which the ſame is marked, he hath authoritie to name what citizen hee will in the ſame magiſtracy, which is in the ſcroll by the ſaid num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber deciphered. So is it with the ſecond, third, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the reſt, ſo that euery Elector by the benefite of lot is made the pronouncer of a particular magiſtrate. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he, to whome the lot of the firſt magiſtrate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, hath pronounced the citizen, that to him ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Sixe of the 9. voices confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted citizen.</note>good, the 9. electors go to voices, of which if the elected haue 6. of his ſide of that number of the 9. ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, then he is preſently entituled in the magiſtracy, &amp; his name recorded in the long ſcroll, in which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all thoſe magiſtracies for which theſe ſeſſions are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9073:22"/>
called, but if he haue fewer then ſixe voices (which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happeneth) then is there another named of the ſame elector, &amp; ſo forward ſtill, vntill in the end one be named, of whom ſixe of the electors ſhal allow: the ſelfe ſame manner is obſerued in the ſecond, third, &amp; all the reſt, vntil the number of thoſe 9. electors haue euery one in particular choſen a particular magiſtrate: while theſe things are in handling in the inner diuided roome, the other citizens in the ſeſſion houſe keepe on their courſe in drawing of lots as they began, &amp; going to the pottes accordingly, as by lot it falleth to their ranks, they draw out bals, vntill 9. others haue out of either pot drawen a golden lot. Theſe fill vp the ſecond row of electors, &amp; they alſo (according vnto the degrees of their age) are placed in the conclaue, or diuided roome: where they find an other chancellor or ſecretary, who without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering one iot from the former, reciteth vnto them the decrees of the ſenate, which they are to obſerue, &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth to the ſelfe ſame magiſtrates a ſcroll of the ſelfe ſame order as the other was, which was brought to the firſt order of electors in the conclaue: &amp; ſo then the lots again are drawen of the electors, and as euery one draweth, ſo according to the number &amp; order aforeſaid doth each of them pronounce a particular cittizen in that magiſtracy, which the number of his lot aſſigneth him. And in like manner the other third 9. obſerue the aforeſaid ceremonies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> point to point: &amp; ſo likewiſe the fourth 9. ſo that in all they fill vp the number of 36. citizens, for ſo many were the golden bals that were in the pot in the middle ſeat: ſo that of 60. citizens which drew out the firſt 60. golden balles 36. doe become ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, &amp; are diuided into 4. ranks: but the twentie foure which drew the ſiluer balles out of the middle pot, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9073:23"/>
of their hope, returne them to their ſeates. I know how difficill a thing it is by writing to ſet downe theſe ſmall particularities, being ſo farre different from the vſe of the ancient Romaines: but I had rather bee blamed for folly, then for want of diligence, for I will not willingly paſſe ouer the ſmalleſt thing, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of it: ſo that none how curious ſoeuer, may in reaſon deſire any more at my hands. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne where I left, there is then in euery office, (for which that day the ſeſſions are appointed) by the foure orders of Electors, four citizens choſen, I meane by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular order of electors a particular citizen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it happen ſome one ſelfe man to bee named of two <note place="margin">The choiſe of the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note>or three of the orders of the electors (which ſometimes happeneth) but for the moſt part there are of euery of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Magiſtracie foure competitors, though in ſome of leſſe dignitie, &amp; marke there are onely two, of which inferior offices the two firſt orders of electors haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to chuſe and name the competitors, of which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge and iuriſdiction the two later orders are fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and depriued: but ſo ſoone as the competitors of all the offices are choſen, preſently the electors are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, neyther may they that day giue their voice more to any one, neither bee ſo much as preſent at the ſeſſions: And then the chiefe ſecretarie (which honor as I ſaid, may not be giuen to a gentleman, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe is of great dignitie and ſway) with a high voice pronounceth from his ſeate the competitors of the firſt magiſtracie, and particularly relateth who is choſen, and of what order of the electors. Neyther omitteth he which of the electors was the firſt author of naming him. In which place me thinkes it ought not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9073:23"/>
to bee let ſlippe, how that it is by law eſtabliſhed, that the ſame elector (who is the author of the pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">The Elector becommeth ſurety for him whom be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth.</note>and choice of any competitor) is reckened to be in manner as a ſuretie for him: for afterwardes hauing gone beyond his competitors, and obtained the deſired office, if hee then chance to conuert to himſelfe any of the publike treaſure, or goods, and be thereof conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and withall remaine vnable to make ſatiſfaction, then that elector by whoſe authority he was created &amp; pronounced, is bound out of his owne ſubſtance to pay the ſame to the treaſure houſe, The competitors of the firſt magiſtracie being then pronounced by the chiefe ſecretary in a high voice, preſently after they are named if they be then preſent, euery one with his parentage, &amp; deareſt friendes and kinsfolke goeth out of the ſeſſion houſe, into an appointed conclaue or inner roome, and there ſtay vntil the magiſtracy be determined of. Then againe after all this, the chiefe ſecretary admoniſheth them all that they are bounde both by diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, without any regard of priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to fauour and aſſiſt him whom they ſhall thinke fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for the honour and commodity of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Then he nameth the firſt competitor, that is, he which was choſen of the firſt order of electors: for whome lottes are to be tryed. Then preſently riſe vp ſo many young men, as will ſerue two to euery ranke of benches. They carry in their handes certaine pottes, made and ioyned together with a maruailous kinde of artifice; the vttermoſt part of which is greene, and the interior white, both couered: whereinto when you put your hande, it is in your choiſe to let your ball fall into which of the two you pleaſe: the manner of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9073:24"/>
pottes being ſo contriued, that no one of thoſe that are preſent, though he behold it neuer ſo ſtedfaſtly, can tell into whether of the two the ball was put: they doe not this with beanes, but with certaine linnen balles, leſt that otherwiſe by the ſound of their fal there might be ſome coniecture made into whether of the pots the bal was let fal for our anceſtors deemed it to be a thing moſt expedient to our commonwealth, that our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might bee free, and therefore they tooke great care, that the ſuffrages might be ſecrete. The yong men therefore euery one with his pots thus ioyned together go euery one to his owne bench, and offer their pottes to euery one of the citizens in order as they ſitte, who ſhewing euery one his ball openly, putteth his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pot, &amp; letteth the ſame fall into whether parte he liſteth. If he will giue his voice in fauour, then into the inner white; if otherwiſe, then into the vttermoſt which is greene: and this order is vſed throughout all the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that in a very ſmall moment of time the whole aſſembly of citizens haue yeelded their ſuffrages. Then the pots are brought to the princes ſeate, and the balles taken out and put into two broad diſhes, that is to ſay, thoſe which were in the white pot, &amp; in fauour into a white diſh, &amp; thoſe which were in the greene pot, &amp; in disfauour, into a greene diſh. Then they are brought to the counſellors (in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of whom the prince ſitteth) to be numbred &amp; told: the ſuffrages of the white diſh fauouring the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor are numbred of thoſe counſellors which ſit on the right hand of the prince: the other of the contrary diſh &amp; contrary effect, are tolde by thoſe counſellors which ſit on the left hand of the prince: the publike ſecretaries
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9073:24"/>
are preſent where the counſellors are, and doe preſently write vp the number both of the one &amp; the other balles that are reckoned. In the mean time while theſe recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are in hand, they begin their ſuffrages for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond competitor, which was choſen of the ſeconde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the electors &amp; in like ſort the ſuffrages are brought to the counſellors, which preſently are numbred, &amp; the ſecretaries regiſter them in writing: the like order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for the third &amp; fourth competitor, if there be ſo many. All the ſuffrages being reckoned vp, he that hath them moſt in his fauour, ſo that they exceede the halfe is pronounced &amp; choſen of the chiefe ſecretary: at ſuch time as the ſeſſions being ended the councel is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. But if it ſo fall out, that none of the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for that magiſtracy haue any more then the iuſt halfe of the lots in his fauour, then is the whole procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding held as voide, and the appointment of that office deferred to the next ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>After that the firſt magiſtracie is in the ſeſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of, then are the names pronounced of thoſe that are elected in the ſecond, &amp; the competitors go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conclaue with their kindred and alliance, &amp; thoſe that were ſhut in before (that is to ſay, the kindred and allyance of the firſt competitors) returne into the ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and the very like order and manner as in the firſt do they obſerue in their ſuffrages for the competitors of the ſecond magiſtracie: which being numbred by the counſellors hee is helde for elected, that exceedeth the reſt in number of voyces, ſo that they exceede the halfe. The Seſſions being ended, the names of the elected are pronounced by the chiefe Secretarie, and then the whole Councell is diſmiſſed: which may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9073:25"/>
               <note place="margin">The councell may not be prolonged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſetting of the Sunne.</note> not at all bee helde or prolonged after the ſunne is once downe: ſo if in that day they make not an ende of all, then do they declare the names of thoſe that are already choſen: and as for thoſe that remaine, there is no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning to bee made at all: ſo that they remaine fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the benefite which the nomination of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors had put them in hope of. And this was ſo orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not without great reaſon, for if the matter ſhoulde haue beene prolonged within night, it would not haue beene eaſie for thoſe magiſtrates that are Preſidentes of the ſeſſions, to containe ſo great a multitude of citizens in order, but that through fauor of the darkeneſſe, they woulde haue attempted ſomewhat preiudiciall to the lawes. Therefore our graue aunceſtors, men indeede wiſe &amp; prouident, preuenting the inconueniences that thereby might happen with exceeding carefulneſſe and wiſedome, ordained that the ſeſſions ſhoulde not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes be continued after the ſetting of the Sunne; neither would that by any meanes that light ſhould bee brought into the hall while the ſeſſions endured. This is the whole manner of the proceeding in the ſeſſions: but by the way it is to be noted, that the offices are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed among the citizens, that two of one family, kindred, or neere alliance, may not by any meanes haue <note place="margin">Two of one, kindred on fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may not haue place in office, nor bee Electors.</note>place in one and the ſame office; neither in the ſeſſions may two of one family, or neere alliance be by benefite of lotte electors (as I ſaid before) the ſame likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained with great reaſon and diſcretion, to the end that the preheminence of publike authoritie might pertaine to many, and not bee engroſſed vp among a few: leaſt thereby through too much greatneſſe of power might become diſturbers or oppreſſors of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9073:25"/>
commonwealth: and on the other ſide, thoſe that doe find themſelues voide and hopeleſſe of honour and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, might grow into a diſlike and hatred of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate of that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which many of the citizens doe ſeeke to alter &amp; vndermine.</note> And without doubt it is almoſt impoſsible for that commonwealth to maintaine it ſelfe afoot, and to ſtand firme, whoſe gouernment many of the citizens do ſeek to alter or vndermine: ſo that nothing is more proper to a commonwealth, then that the common authority and power ſhould belong to many: for it is iuſt that the citizens, by whom the ſtate of the Cittie is maintained, being otherwiſe among themſelues equall, ſhould not in this diſtribution of honours bee made vnequall. But they that do reduce the publike authority into a few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, doe eaſily fall vppon that eſtate of gouernment, which the Greeks call <hi>Oligarchia.</hi> Therefore in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> the offices are ſo diuided among the citizens, that inſo much as may be, euery family &amp; kindred may be pertaker of the publike honors and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and yet in that meaſure, that not euery one do go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, but thoſe onely that doe excell the reſt in hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and wiſedome, and are deemed to be ſuch men, as will more regard the publike, then the priuate common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. That firſt inſtitution hath I know not what of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, but the other ſauoureth only of the gouernment of the Nobilitie: whereby it is manifeſt that there is in this cittie of ours an excellent contriued mixture of the beſt and iuſteſt gouernments: for though vpon the firſt viewe this great councell of ours ſeeme to beare the ſhew of a popular eſtate, yet looking well into it, you ſhall find therein an apparant entermixture of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment or the nobility. I grant that the election of

               <note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice is neither a popular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nor an Olygarchy, but a wel tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both.</note> magiſtrates by lot is a matter popular, eſpecially where right and iuſtice is meaſured, not by a determinate pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but ſimply by an arithmetical equality: for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering (ſay they) that euery one is a cittizen &amp; freeman, one as well as another, and that among equalles things ought equally to bee diuided, euery one ought to bee ſweetned alike with participation of the honours and commodities of the commonwealth, without more excluſion of one more then another: now in regarde that all cannot rule at once, but by turnes, they thinke fit that the matter ſhould be committed meerely to lot, &amp; that they ſhould rule, to whome the ſame ſhould bee fauourable. The contrary is alleadged by thoſe, where full power &amp; authority conſiſteth in the mightineſſe of a few, for they ſuppoſe vnequall thinges to belong to vnequall perſons, and that therefore mean men ſhould content themſelues with a meane &amp; honorleſſe eſtate, &amp; that the great and higheſt dignities ſhould belong to them that do fartheſt exceed the reſt in riches: in which reckoning eyther of both parties ſtrayeth far wide from the true &amp; perfect path, though eyther of them relyeth vpon a reaſon in apparance ſeeming true, for wheras the one affirmeth equall thinges to belong to equall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; the other that men vnequal in riches ſhould be vnequall in gouernment: the firſt meaſuring the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; likenes only by number, &amp; the other the vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and imparitie onely by riches, they are without doubt both of them beſides the cuſhion: For they that are in number equall, are in ſome ſort equall, but not wholly, &amp; thoſe that are in riches vnequall, though in ſome ſort vnequall, yet are they not wholly to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vnequall: but the inſtitution of a ciuill life ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9073:26"/>
chiefly to liue wel, it is only vertue that muſt make this difference. To thoſe then that do excell the reſt in vertue, the chiefeſt honors are due, as being moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, &amp; aboue the equalitie of the reſt, and ſo likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall rule and dignitie belongeth to thoſe that are in vertue equall, and in ciuill induſtry: and this is the true meaſure &amp; perfect rule to diſtinguiſh men. As therefore the choiſe of electors by lot is popular: ſo doeth it alſo ſauor of a noble &amp; better gouernment, that they ſhould bee chieflieſt aduanced in honor, that do chieflieſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the reſt in vertue, iudgement, and counſell, and that the vnworthier ſhould receiue the repulſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may plainly perceiue, that in this manner of our gouernment there is mingled with a popular ſhew, the forme of a nobler rule, yet vſed with ſuch temperature, that the ſame doth not exceed, nor go beyond the mean &amp; manner of the popular authority. For in choice of the electors onely chance ruleth; of which dignitie the worſt and baſeſt may without hurt or detriment of the commonwealth, be partakers in equall power with the beſt &amp; worthieſt citizens, but in the eſſentiall diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honors and dignities chaunce hath no power at all, the ſame being wholly done by a deliberate election &amp; aduiſed iudgement. And here me thinketh, I ought not to ouerſlip in ſilence, that in thoſe ſeſſions, which do concerne the beſtowing of offices, to which men of the greateſt wiſedome, honeſty &amp; diligence are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the ſenate of it ſelfe maketh vp a fift order, to the 4. <note place="margin">The ſenate when any principall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to be prouided for, hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to create a fift compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor.</note>before expreſſed orders of electors. For whiles the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther electors ſeperated in conclaues or places appointed for that purpoſe, do pronounce ſuch to be competitors, as they ſhal in their iudgements think meet, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ſo be the ſeſſions do concerne any ſuch eſpecial office, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, the ſenate doth alſo withdraw it ſelfe into an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9073:27"/>
inner chamber, and there euery Senator hath power to name ſuch one as he ſhall pleaſe in the office, of which the preſent queſtion is: and whoſoeuer ſhall chance to haue moſt voyces in his fauour, is elected in this cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of the Senate, and created the fift Competitor: whereby it plainely appeareth, that in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of ours the forme of an Ariſtocracie is much more excellent then the popular gouernment. But the manner and meanes of this kind of councell is hitherto (vnleſſe I be deceiued) of vs ſufficiently expreſſed and made plaine. Let vs now come to that part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the which not vnlike to a well tuned dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſon in muſicke, where the baſe is to the treble aptly proportioned, carrying with it the ſhew of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, hath notwithſtanding a correſpondency with the popular gouernment, and finally a middle ſort of Magiſtrates being betweene them both interpoſed, doth grow (as it were) into a wel concenting harmony of an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He exterior ſhew of the prince in the Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> deliuereth to the eyes of the beholders the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a king, and the very reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a monarchie: Therefore it ſhal not in my opinion do amiſſe if hauing deſcribed that aſſembly of citizens, which repreſenteth the forme of a popular eſtate (though for the dignity of the matter vnſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, yet conſidering the ſlenderneſſe of our forces not altogether vndiligently) if we now take vpon vs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the firſt reaſon that moued our wiſe &amp; vertuous aunceſtors to place one man onely at the helme of their commonwealth, and alſo when and what was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this royall and princely inſtitution. No man (I ſuppoſe) is ignorant of that which is ſo often of vs in this worke repeated, which is, that a Cittie is a certaine ciuill ſocietie, ſufficing within it ſelfe of ſuch thinges as are neceſſarie to the leading of a happie and quiet life: and there is no queſtion to be made, but that euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſocietie is contained and linked together in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnitie, and by diſtraction and breach of that vnity is againe as eaſily diſſolued. For nothing hath ſooner ouerthrowne the mightie and opulent eſtate of many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9073:28"/>
great &amp; glorious citties that hereto fore haue periſhed, then homebred diſcord and ciuill diſſention. Now a vnitie cannot well be contayned, vnleſſe one being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in authoritie aboue, not onely the vulgar multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but alſo all the reſt of the citizens and officers, haue authoritie to combine them together, being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered &amp; diſioynted, and to bind them (as it were) all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one entire body: which the great philoſophers that were the ſearchers out, and (as it were) diuers into the ſecretes of Nature, did notably marke and obſerue, as well in the conſtitution of the whole worlde, as alſo of this Microcoſme or little worlde, which is Man. For they well founde out, that in this vniuerſitie of thinges the many and diſagreeing motions of each particular thing, according to the nature thereof, were all vpheld and maintayned vnder one heauenly and eternall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſo likewiſe all cauſes vnder one, the firſt cauſe of all things: and as in a liuing creature there are many and diuers members, whoſe functions are ſundrie and different: yet neuertheleſſe are all compriſed vnder one onely life &amp; member, which is the hart, and are by the ſame (as it were) gathered &amp; held in a vnity: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the multitude be not ſo ordered &amp; digeſted, that it may acknowledge one head and ſuperior, in whoſe heart ſhal reſt principallie engraued, an eſpeciall care to conſerue the common good, &amp; the perfection of ciuill agreement (whereunto the actions as well of euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate citizen, as publike magiſtrate, as to the laſt chiefe &amp; principal end ought to be directed) ſurely the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long time continue, but drawing diuers waies muſt needs fal to decay &amp; ruine: for if the charge of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good be not principally to ſome one committed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9073:28"/>
of neceſſity the too intentiue care that euery one will haue of the particular office wherein hee is imployed, muſt needs turne to the common hinderance: as for example: The officers for prouiſion of corne wil cauſe out of all parts great quantities to be brought to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, procuring onely the cheapenes and plenty thereof, which perchance woulde not proue ſo profitable to the publike tolles. The officers likewiſe of the nauie and ſea matters (which are among vs of great eſtimation &amp; credit) would induſtriate themſelues peraduenture too much thereabout, in building great numbers of gallies, in gloriouſly adorning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with all ſorts of coſt &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like inſtruments, ſpending therin whatſoeuer of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treaſure they could get into their fingers, through which ouer coſtly diligence, the reſt of the publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts wold hardly ſuffice to repair caſtels, &amp; wals of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, to pay garriſons, &amp; to defray other publike char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. By which meanes the commonwealth not cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wel together, might eaſily ſuſtain detriment, not by the faultines, but by the too much carefulnes of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whileſt euery one endeuoureth to ſet forth &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his office in the notableſt maner he may: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeemeth exceeding neceſſary, that the care of the publike weale ſhould be committed to ſome one, who being free from any priuate office, might onely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat &amp; direct the endeuors of the reſt to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good &amp; vtility of all, which authority to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted equally to many, were very inconuenient: for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that which many haue charge alike of, all do in a maner alike neglect: neither if ther be any thing amiſſe, can the blame therof be imputed more to one then to another: withall there neuer want moſt dangerous emulations
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9073:29"/>
among thoſe that are alike equall in authoritie. Now if one in this caſe ſhould bee preferred and aduanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt, in dignitie and rule with a limitation of time, and not for tear me of his life, he then would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he had ſufficiently diſcharged his duety, if it went well with the commonwealth during his time of gouernment, careleſſe altogether what ſhould become thereof afterward: ſo that commonly many dangerous afterclappes enſue ſuch reckonings, which by certaine and manifeſt experience may eaſily bee proued by the example of many commonwealthes, that in theſe times of ours haue beene ruinated through ſuch manner of gouernment.</p>
            <p>This Monarchall gouernment was therefore eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this commonwealth of ours with ſingular wiſedome and iudgement, and withall the ſame ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed &amp; reſtrained with lawes, that all dangerous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, whereby the commonwealth might ſuſtain harme, are thereby remoued, and thoſe commodities joyntly embraſed that proceed from a kingly and royal gouernment: ſo that there ſeemeth nothing to remaine which we could wiſh for, hauing a commonwealth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enthralled, enioying a true libertie and freedome, and yet neuertheleſſe as it were a king for our gouernor. A prince therefore is choſen, who is entituled with the dignitie of a Duke, retayning the gouernment of the commonwealth while the time of his life endureth, and chiefly and aboue all other thinges, hauing care of the common good and generall vtilitie, by which as I proued before (and that as I thinke with ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) cities are preſerued and maintained.</p>
            <p>This Duke of ours hath not any certaine priuate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9073:29"/>
alotted him, yet neuertheles ther is not in the whole <note place="margin">The dignity &amp; authority of the Duke.</note>commonwealth any thing done, but he muſt be made acquainted therewith, and haue knowledge of the ſame. He is to containe and keep vnder in their duetie, as well euery priuate man as euery particular magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and with ſuch moderation to direct them, that euery thing may with an excellent harmony ſeeme to tune to the common good &amp; ciuil vnion: leſt any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe through too much diligence, or too much negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his office, might chaunce to hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profite. This therefore is the office of the prince, that being (as it were) placed in a glaſſe, hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what euery one doth, eſpecially thoſe that are in authority, of whom if he find any faulty in his office, if the matter bee light, hee calleth him before the whole colledge, and there ſharpely rebuketh him with words: if his offence be of greater qualitie, he cauſeth the ſame to be enquired of and examined before the aduocators and the preſidents of the tenne, and to be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence of the councell. The Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo if he will, may vſe the authority eyther of an Aduocator or Preſident, and make report to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of any offence, and of any amercement or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is thereupon to be inflicted: (wherein what manner and cuſtome is wont to be obſerued, ſhall bee hereafter expreſſed, when wee ſhall come to ſpeake of criminall iudgements.) For ſo great is the princes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that he may in whatſoeuer court adioine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Magiſtrate therein, being preſident as his colleague or companion, and haue equall power with the other Preſidents, that he might ſo by this meanes be able to looke into all things.</p>
            <p>

Yet neuertheles ſo is this authoritie of his by lawes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that alone hee may not doe any thing, neither being ioyned to the other magiſtrates hath he any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power then euery other preſident in his office. The authoritie of the magiſtrates being ſo ſmall, that no one of them how great ſoeuer he bee can determine of any thing of waight or moment without the opinion of the Councell. But of this in his place we will ſpeake more plainely.</p>
            <p>Beſides this the prince hath in euery councell equall authoritie with any of them for one ſuffrage or lotte. Likewiſe in the great counſell, and aſſembly of all the citizens, while the ſeſſions are held concerning magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, hee hath no power to yeelde more fauour to a competitor of his kindred or parentage, then to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: obſeruing the ſame equall priuledge which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citizens doe: whereby I thinke any man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily vnderſtand, that the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is depriued of all meanes, whereby he might abuſe his authoritie, or become a tyrant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ancient &amp; long continued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome from the firſt beginnings of the citie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theſe times, hath now taken ſuch foundation and roote, that there is nothing whereof the citie of <hi>Venice</hi> need ſtand leſſe in feare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that their prince ſhould at any time be able to inuade their liberty, or trouble their common quiet. But now leaſt euery one ſhould refuſe this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; requiring ſo great paines &amp; continuall ſolicitude of mind, vnleſſe there ſhould thereunto bee adioyned ſome ſweetnes or reward: this limitation of authoritie is on the other ſide recompenſed with an exterior princely honor, dignitie, &amp; royall appearing ſhew: for the ornamentes of his bodie are kingly, vſing alwaies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9073:30"/>
purple garments or cloth of gold. On his head he wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in ſtead of a diadem, a vaile of linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon the ſame a hood or miter of purple, garniſhed about with a fringe of golde, the part whereof that couereth the middle or hinder parte of the head riſeth vp in forme of a horne. His ſeat is ſomewhat higher then the reſt, and in eſtate kingly. All the citizens, as well thoſe that beare rule and office, as thoſe that are priuate men ſpeake vnto him bareheaded and ſtanding, which in theſe times is a ſigne of exceeding honor. The prince neuer riſeth vp to any perſon. All the letters of the commonwealth are ſealed, and go forth vnder his name. What prince, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, Magiſtrate, Captaine, or whoſoeuer els that writeth to the ſenate, directeth his letters to the prince. The proclamations of lawes, orders, &amp; decrees, all are done vnder his name. All their money, as well gold as ſiluer is coyned and ſtamped with his name &amp; picture. Finally to ſhorten my ſpeech, in euery thing you may ſee the ſhewe of a king, but his authority in nothing, which without doubt whoſoeuer is wiſe cannot but confeſſe to haue beene ordained by the Venetian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth with exceeding prudence and wiſedome: becauſe otherwiſe without this rewarde of honour, the office of the prince would haue been reputed as burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous &amp; vnpleaſing, but that the reward, which is honor following, ſweetneth the ſame, according to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great philoſophers: ſo that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Ethikes</hi> ſeeing thoſe that do rightly &amp; holily performe their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in gouernment, haue more reſpect to the profite of other men, then their owne: there cannot by any other meanes be returned vnto them a due and equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent recompence, but onely by making them to exceed all the reſt in honor and dignity. Moreouer the dignity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9073:31"/>
of this prince cauſeth all the other citizens exceedingly to feare his reprehenſion, and performe the offices in which they are placed, with the greater fidelity &amp; care. There are to the prince adioyned ſixe counſellors of <note place="margin">Sixe counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors choſen out of ſixe quarters of the citie.</note>ſixe tribes, into which the Citie is diuided, euery tribe chuſing one. Their office continueth eight monethes, &amp; they are continually at the princes elbow: nothing is ſaid vnto the prince but they do heare it: no letters are ſent forth but ſuch as ſhall ſeeme good and alowable to foure of thoſe counſellors, who alſo doe in the letters ſubſcribe their names; yet not in thoſe letters which are ſent forth, but in thoſe which are firſt written by the ſecretaries of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealth, which are reſerued, &amp; the coppies of them ſent forth. In which alſo it is to be noted, that thoſe letters which are ſent, not by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the councell, but by the commandement of the Prince and Counſellors, as they neuer contain but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall importance, ſo are they of ſmall authority. For as wee haue often ſaide, all authoritie and power is onely to bee attributed to the councell, no one magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hauing of himſelfe any ample authoritie. But of the counſellors we will ſpeake more hereafter: now I will returne to the prince or Duke.</p>
            <p>The Prince therefore being honored with this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparance and ſhewe, becauſe oftentimes it fell out that priuate wealth ſuffiſed not to maintayne ſo great dignity and pompe: there is allowed vnto the Duke out of the common treaſure yearely, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and fiue hundred crownes of gold: and to the end leaſt ſome one couetous of increaſing his ſubſtance, ſhould neglect the honour &amp; dignitie of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, &amp; conuert that money to his priuate vſe, there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9073:31"/>
are certaine charges impoſed vpon him, which at his owne coſt he muſt ſee defrayed, with an eſpeciall care of the ſeruice &amp; dignity of the commonwealth: which if through auarice or ſparing of money he neglect, there is ſo great a fine and amercement ſet vpon the heade of his heires, that whiles by increaſing his priuate wealth, and diſpenſing with his honour and dignity, hee ſhall think to enrich them, he ſhall in a manner vtterly vndoo them: beſides the leauing of an eternall blot and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy to his poſteritie. He maintayneth of his owne charge many ſeruants, or as you would ſay of his guard, but yet ſuch as weare no weapons. Hee alwaies vſeth coſtly garments: he dwelleth in a pallace wonderfully adorned with goodly chambers and tapiſtry, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with veſſels of ſiluer and all other ſuch furniture, as is beſeeming the degree of a prince. Foure times a yeare he maketh a ſolemne and ſumptuous banket, to <note place="margin">Foure times a yeare the Duke ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteth the citizens.</note>aboue threeſcore citizens, the ſame being ordered and ſet forth with all the magnificency that may be. Wher. in our predeceſſors brought into our commonwealth the auncient order of the inhabitantes of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> (whoſe commonwealthes were noble and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) but with a much better moderation and order: for they becauſe they thought the often meeting of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens was a mean to combine them together in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, inſtituted certaine publike feaſtes at the charge of the common treaſure, to which the citizens aſſembling had meanes one to be acquainted with the other, and withal by ſo friendly a meeting to confirm a new friend ſhip. But ſeeing that they all went confuſedly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe aſſemblies could not be without troubles &amp; tumultes, and beſides when thoſe that were to feaſt &amp;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9073:32"/>
banket the reſt, did deſire to do it with daintineſſe, and magnificence, there could not but enſue a great waſt of the common treaſure. Therefore with a certain amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; moderation is that ancient manner brought in vſe among the Venetians, and the whole care and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thereof committed to the prince. Foure times a yeare therfore are the citizens banqueted of the prince, with fare truely honorable and daintie, and yet for the exceedingneſſe thereof not to be enuied: neyther doth euery one come vnorderly as it pleaſeth him, but thoſe whome the prince ſhall vouchſafe to call: vnleſſe it bee the Counſellors, the Aduocators, the Preſidents of the xl. men, &amp; the Preſidents of the tennes, who in prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of their offices, are vſually preſent at the princes bankets: the other citizens come not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited.</p>
            <p>Theſe foure feaſtings are in this ſort diuided, that the elder and worthieſt citizens being inuited, doe in the winter time vpon <hi>S. Stephens</hi> day aſſemble themſelues in the publike pallace appointed for the princes habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a ſolemne pompe waite vpon the prince from thence to the church of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> and there bee preſent with him at Maſſe, which being ended, then they waite vppon him backe to his houſe againe, and there be pertakers of his banquet. Likewiſe in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Aprill on the day of Saint <hi>Marke</hi> (whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is with exceeding honour ſolemnized of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, as entituling him their patron and defender, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the reliques of his body were brought vnto <hi>Venice,</hi> from forth of <hi>Alexandria</hi> a noble Citie of <hi>Aegypt)</hi> the cittizens of leſſe age and dignitie inuited of the prince, doe in like manner (after the ſolemnities in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9073:32"/>
church are ended) conuay him home and dine with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vppon <hi>Aſcention</hi> day, being the day of the great fayer at <hi>Venice,</hi> they are inuited and admitted to the Princes banket, that are fully arriued and entred into that age which we call <hi>Virilis</hi> or mans eſtate. Theſe alſo doe early in the morning waite vpon the Duke from his houſe, and go aborde a ſhip gorgeouſly trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſet forth, reſerued onely to that vſe, and is by the Venetians called <hi>Bucentoro:</hi> ſo ſoone as they are paſſed the mariſhes and come to behold the plaine and open ſea, by an ancient indulgence of the high Biſhops (who honoured this commonwealth of ours, in regard of many notable exploites by it atchieued againſt the <note place="margin">The Dake of Venice mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſea with a ring of gold.</note>enemies of the Chriſtian faith) the prince throwing a ring of golde into the ſea, vſeth in a manner theſe ſpeaches, that with that ring hee doeth betroth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſea, in token of a true and perpetuall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre. To this there are added certayne ceremonies by the Patriarch of the Cittie, which being ended, they lande at the Church dedicated to Saynt <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> a thing of great antiquitie, built vppon that ſhore or banke which diuideth the ſea from the lakes. There the holy miſteries are celebrated, which being ended, they go aborde the ſhip againe, and returne to <hi>Venice,</hi> attending on the Prince home to his houſe, where they dyne with him.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt banquette pertayneth to the young cittizens, who the twelue Kalendes of Iuly, on the day dedicated to the two Martyres <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Modeſtus,</hi> doe with ſolemne pompe wayte vpon the Prince to the Temple of thoſe Martirs, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9073:33"/>
is ſituate neere to the great channell that diuideth the cittie in the middeſt: which channell is for that tyme conioyned with a bridge made vpon two galleyes, leaſt otherwiſe to make that iourney, would coſt a very long and labourſome circuit and compaſſe. The church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſited, and the ſolemnities in the church finiſhed, they attend vpon the prince home to his pallace, where they are receiued with a royall &amp; magnificent banket. There are to theſe bankets admitted dauncers, ieſters, and excellent ſingers, to recreate &amp; delight the gueſtes, and withal certaine ſports and playes are intermingled, which doe moue exceeding mirth and pleaſure: and this ancient cuſtome is ſtill obſerued in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> though ſomewhat moderated. For by this means the citizens in a manner of euery degree, yea equals with equalles are entertayned at the princes table: which ſeemeth exceedingly well ordered and diſpoſed, as well for the dignity of the prince, as alſo for nouriſhing &amp; maintayning loue and good will among the citizens. But becauſe euery citizen that is a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, cannot euery yeare receiue this grace of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited, it is by an olde law ordained, leaſt any one ſhould ſeeme to be left out, that the prince ſhould in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time ſende to euery citizen that hath priuiledge of <note place="margin">A ſtrange ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Duke of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, but now the ſame is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, &amp; the wild ducks changed into a peece of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer coyne.</note>voyce in the greater Councell fiue wild duckes, as a portion or ſhare of the publike banket, which likewiſe is a great meane to the Duke of winning the loue and goodwill of the citizens.</p>
            <p>In theſe chargeable expences doth the Duke yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſume and ſpend a great part of that money which hee receiueth out of the common treaſure: ſo that though the Duke would be couetous, yet cannot hee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9073:33"/>
in a manner ſtaine with any baſeneſſe the nobleneſſe &amp; dignity of the place he holdeth.</p>
            <p>Here becauſe the whole power and authority of the prince is in a manner already expreſſed of vs, it ſhal not be amiſſe to declare in what ſeaſon and time the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of creating a Duke in <hi>Venice,</hi> and finally what is the order of the ſeſſions in his election.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Duke in Venice.</note> Immediately from the firſt beginning of the Cittie, when the nobleſt citizens of the Venetian prouince, (their greateſt citties, as <hi>Aquileia, Altina, Concordia, Vderzo, Padoua,</hi> and many other of great opulencie and richeſſe, being ruinated by the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Attyla</hi> their Captaine, who filled <hi>Italy</hi> with fire and blood) did aſſemble themſelues in thoſe flattes of the Adriatique ſea, where <hi>Venice</hi> ſince was builded, &amp; euery one of them had choſen for his manſion thoſe places which were neareſt to the country which hee had abandoned: it came to paſſe that there were by them built about two and twentie townes, partly vpon that ſhore or bank which encloſeth the inner lakes, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon certaine hillockes which appeared out aboue the lakes. But in the beginning when thoſe townes were neither of themſelues ſufficiently fortified and fenced, neither euery of them ſo furniſhed with ſhipping, that it was able to reſiſt the incurſions of theeues and pirates, they thought it meete (ſeeing their fortunes were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) to gouerne their matters by a common councell, as well for the prouiſion of corne, wine, fruites, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries, as alſo the ſecuritie of their perſons and families, thereby to auoide the daunger of pyrates and rouers, to which in regarde of their weake, ſcattered &amp; vnfortified townes, they lay in a manner open. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9073:34"/>
when firſteuery towne had choſen from out his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citizens a chiefe and ſufficient man, calling him by <note place="margin">Euery towne did chuſe a Tribune.</note>the name or title of Tribune, they generally altogether ordained, that vpon certain appointed daies theſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes ſhould meete, and conſult together the common buſineſſe: but finding in the end an inconuenience in the varietie of ſo many opinions and authorities, and ſuffring withal many incommodities, they thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would doe better then to lay the whole charge of the generall and common affaires vppon ſome one particular man, whom all the reſt ſhould acknowledge as their prince and ruler. It was therefore by generall conſent of the xxij. townes concluded and agreed, that <note place="margin">The princes ſeate aſſigned him in the towne of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea.</note>there ſhould one Duke or Prince be choſen, &amp; his ſeate aſſigned him at the beginning, in the towne of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> ſituated on the inner ſide of the lakes, in a certaine Ilande neere to the mouth of the riuer <hi>Piaue,</hi> which in our time (by inundation of the flouds) is now ioyned to the firme lands, But afterwards this place ſeeming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, becauſe it was farre off, ſo that many times afore the prince could haue aduertiſement, the Pyrates had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entred the lakes, oppreſſed at vnwares the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, &amp; ſpoiled their ſhipping. Therefore they thought <note place="margin">The princes ſeat tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moco.</note>it better that the prince leauing <hi>Heraclea</hi> ſhoulde plant his ſeat in <hi>Malamoco,</hi> a towne ſeated vpon the midſt of the banke: whence the Duke might eaſily &amp; ſoon haue inckling of any whatſoeuer attempt of the Pyrates, and <note place="margin">Pipin inuaded Italy.</note>with ſmall adoo bee at hand whereſoeuer his preſence <note place="margin">The princes ſeat laſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</note>ſhould be requiſit. But at length when <hi>Pipin</hi> (euen in thoſe very beginnings of the Venetian citie) threatned ſeruitude &amp; ſlaughter, &amp; they abandoning (in a maner) the reſt of the townes, they came altogether to <hi>Rialta,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:9073:34"/>
thither alſo was the ſeate of the prince tranſlated, by which meanes <hi>Venice</hi> in time encreaſed, and grew into that greatneſſe in which we now do ſee it: ſo that by a perpetuall continuing cuſtome, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there alwayes was a prince and gouernour of the Venetian commonwealth. At firſt for a while their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was greater: but afterwardes being by vſe of time and experience taught, they began with holeſome ſtatutes and lawes to abridge his power, bringing it by degrees into this temperature, in which wee now doe ſee it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner of chooſing the Duke of Venice.</note> The manner of chuſing a ſucceſſor to the deceaſed Duke, was at the firſt altogether ſimple, and without ceremony: for our aunceſtors being men of great ſoundneſſe and integritie, &amp; free from all ambition, did euery one in his particular, draw backe from accepting a matter of ſo great a charge: ſo that by a generall crie &amp; acclamation of the people, he was proclaimed prince that was reputed to be the honeſteſt &amp; wiſeſt man: But after thoſe times, the Citie and people increaſing to a greater mightineſſe &amp; ſtate, it ſeemed a thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to the greatnes of ſo noble a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, to commit to the raſh &amp; wauering voice of the multitude, a matter of ſo great waight, honor, and dignity. It was therfore decreed, that there ſhould be choſen out 11. of the moſt ſufficient citizens, &amp; that this authority of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the prince ſhold be wholy vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: but afterwards as with their empire their ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> increaſed, there were appointed certain ſeueral parliaments or ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp; a kind of intricate way found out in this electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Duke, which (leaſt there ſhould be any thing wanting in my vndertaken taske) I wil briefly expreſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9073:35"/>
The Duke being deade, and his obſequies deuoutly and honourably ſolemnized: the Counſellors, who preſently vpon the princes death during the interregne or vacancy, betaking themſelues to the publike pallace, appointed for the princes habitation, do call &amp; aſſemble <note place="margin">The Dukes actions exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined after his death.</note>together the great councell. In that firſt aſſemblie after the Dukes deceaſe, there are (according to the maner of the ſeſſions before expreſſed) 5. citizens created, whoſe office is diligently to looke into &amp; to examine the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the deceaſed prince, and if they found any thing done by him againſt the lawes and ſtatutes, then by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and authoritie of the councell to cancel and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull the ſame. If he haue receiued a bribe of any man, or haue been ſparing in that due and ordinary expence which belongeth to his dignitie, then vpon the report of theſe fiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, there is ſuch a fine and amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement impoſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heires, as the lawes command: the penaltie is onely money, which is leuied vpon the Princes inheritance, &amp; caried into the treaſure houſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſame ſeſſion are likewiſe choſen fiue other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who immediatly vppon their election doe retire themſelues into an aparted roome, or conclaue adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſeſſion houſe, out of which they doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, till after many matters well debated, they doe at length determine whether there is any thing that in their opinion ought to be taken away, or added to the princes authoritie. The matter being well diſcuſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the councel is called together again, which being done, they then come forth of the conclaue (for before they may not) and euery of them declareth his opinion to the Councell concerning the authority of the prince, and then it being of the whole aſſembly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9073:35"/>
aduiſed on: it is by ſuffrages decreed which ſhal be moſt for good of the commonwealth.

The authority and power of the prince being once ſetled and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: the next day after is ſpent in that intricate kinde of ſeſſions, in which the Prince is accuſtomed to bee choſen.</p>

So ſoone as hee is founde out, hee is immediatly by thoſe Magiſtrates brought into the ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thence into the Conclaue to his fellowes, without ſuffring him to ſpeake or talke with any man by the way: thereby to exclude all ambition and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornation out of the ſeſſions, which the will of our aunceſtors was, ſhoulde be handled with all vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſinceritie. By this meanes the fortie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned cittizens doe come together vnawares, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come together, the Councell is preſently diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Then theſe fortie doe come forth agayne out of the cloſet into a large and open hall before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and there by the ſame manner of lotterie as is <note place="margin">The 40. redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to 12.</note>before expreſſed, twelue of the fortie are choſen, and the other eyght and twentie which remaine, are put backe and forſaken.

               <note place="margin">The 45. redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to 11.</note> and ſo put into the cloſet.

            <p>Our anceſtors (being men moſt wiſe and vertuous) <note place="margin">The cauſe of this intricate proceeding in the Dukes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note>made choiſe of this ſtrange and intricate proceeding, to the ende the whole multitude might ſeeme to haue a part in this creation &amp; election of their prince. For the electors of the firſt order are made by lotte, of which all the citizens are capable: next which they mingled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but in ſort that election ſhould exceede the lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: becauſe no man may receiue any fauour by the benefite of lottes, vnleſſe the ſame bee allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of the firſt order: but in the next order they would not that chaunce or lot ſhould haue any force at all: becauſe they thought it vnfit and full of inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to commit the choice of thoſe that were to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of their prince, to the temerity and arbiterment of fortune: in ſort that neyther is the multitude wholly depriued of this authority, neyther yet is the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the wauering witte of the inconſiderate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, among whom commonly a vaine opinion and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded fauour may doe more, then a ſetled iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that are wiſe and vertuous. Beſides, the not knowing who they are that are to be electors of the prince, but the determination of the whole depending vpon thoſe that are fortunate in their lottes: all aſpiring
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9073:37"/>
pretenſions and ambitions, are thereby clearely cut off and taken away: becauſe it may eaſily come to paſſe, that thoſe with whom there is any practiſe entertained, ſhall not haue any authoritie at all. But to returne to the matter: the manner of the ſeſſions being in this ſort accompliſhed, the one and fortie electors of the prince, immediately vpon their election, without ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſpeaking to any man doe go into that Court, in which the ſenate is accuſtomed to aſſemble, where hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diuine ſeruice, which is celebrated with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity &amp; deuotion, laying their handes vpon the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, they do promiſe with oath to God, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, that they will chuſe him for their Duke, whome they ſhall eſteeme to bee worthieſt and of beſt deſert, as well in loue towards his countrey, as in piety, carefulneſſe and prudence, and then the prieſtes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they onely are encloſed &amp; lockt within the Court alone, without ſo much as a ſeruant ſuffred to be among them. Then three of the eldeſt do ſit down by at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain table fitted for that purpoſe, vpon the which there ſtandeth a pot, and euery elector writeth in a little ſcrol the name of him whom he thinketh fitte to bee created Duke, which ſcrolles being firſt all well medled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are put into the potte, of which one is taken out, ſuch as ſhall by chance come into the hand of him that taketh it forth. The ſcroll being read, hee whoſe name is therein contayned, if he bee preſent (as for the moſt parte it happeneth) goeth preſently out of the Court. Then if any ſhall thinke him to be a man vnfit, or vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, or vnworthy of ſo great a dignity, or for any other cauſe ſhall not thinke his creation to bee for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9073:38"/>
good of the commonwealth, he riſeth vp, and with an honeſt modeſtie ſpeaketh his opinion, declaring the cauſe why he thinketh it vnmeet that he ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and created Duke: when he hath ended his ſpeech, the partie is called in againe, and the eldeſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany declareth the obiections made againſt him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies prouided that he neuer nameth the author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for they are all firſt bound by ſolemne oath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue perpetuall ſilence. He on the other ſide excuſeth and confuteth (in the beſt ſort he may) the matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged againſt him. After which hee auoydeth the court againe, &amp; then if the firſt or any other will charge him a freſh with any other matter, it is in their libertie to doe it: and he againe being called in, hath libertie to aunſwere in his iuſtification, and ſo till the matter is by turne handled, till his accuſers be ſilent, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing any farther to vrge againſt him.</p>
            <p>Then at laſt go they to their lottes: Somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our time if the firſt had had 25. ſuffrages in his fauour, then was there no farther reckoning made <note place="margin">Andrea Gritti Duke of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</note>of the reſt, but he was ſtraight proclaimed for Duke: but in our time in thoſe ſeſſions in which <hi>Andrea Gritti</hi> (a moſt honourable Senator) was proclaymed Duke, this cuſtome was altered. For although none bee ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Prince vnleſſe he haue fiue and twentie ſuffrages: yet the matter conſiſteth not as before it did, in him that firſt obtayneth that number, but proceedeth ſtill forward to the reſt, ſo that if any go beyond that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; hee then is proclaymed Duke, and not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. After the lottery is ended concerning him whoſe name was firſt drawen, then is there an other ſcroll taken
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9073:38"/>
forth of the pot, and all things concerning the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in euery point as the former: and ſo the thirde, fourth, &amp; finally all: but if no one of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber haue in his fauour the complete ſumme of thoſe ſuffrages, then if the day be not too farre ſpent, the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are once againe begun in the ſame manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and to the end that the expedition ſhould be the greater, it is not lawfull for any of the electors to depart thence, neyther haue they liberty to ſpeake with any ſtranger, till fiue and twenty of them are agreed in the election of the Duke: whom ſo ſoone as they haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and choſen, the Counſellors are preſently called into the court, who firſt doe with all reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſalute the new prince. The fame of which preſently flyeth through the citie: in euery parte whereof you may behold the citizens making ioy, and throwing vp <note place="margin">The ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the prince.</note>their prayers to heauen for this prince, that his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may bee fortunate and happie to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. All his parents and kinſefolkes come preſently vnto the Court, congratulating with him, of this his great honor and dignitie: in meane while the coyners are ſet a worke to ſtampe money, with the face &amp; name of the prince, and all thinges buſily prepared that the future pompe requireth: in which ſeaſon the Duke and the Counſellors doe apparell themſelues, and being apparelled and in order, doe ſo diſcende out of the Court, and go directly vnto the Church of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> being neere thereunto adioyning, a church of wonderfull goodlineſſe and magnificence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendiſhing in all ſortes and varietie of rich ornaments and pompous architecture. They do firſt religiouſly, &amp;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9073:39"/>
with great veneration, adore the mighty name of God, &amp; then do all aſcend vp into a high &amp; ſtately ſeat, made all of Porphire ſtone, whence the eldeſt of the electors maketh a ſpeech vnto the people, wherein he declareth the creation of the newe Duke, vttering withall ſome few wordes in a modeſt commendation of him. After whom the Duke alſo maketh an oration, in which after hauing ſpoken diſcreetly a few things concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: hee there promiſeth and voweth to obſerue all ſuch things as ſhal become a vertuous prince, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of the good of the commonwealth, then of any his owne priuate commodity: chiefly that he will beare himſelfe in matter of iuſtice moſt holily and ſtrictly, with endeuour that equall right may be adminiſtred to all men, that hee will not ſpare his priuate ſubſtance, his labour, no nor his life: if by any incommodity of his the eſtate of the commonwealth might bee aſſiſted or remedied. Finally, he humbly prayeth vnto God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>S. Marke</hi> (vnder whoſe patronage the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> is) and to all the Saints, that they will be all fauourable and helpefull vnto him in the well diſcharging of this great and honourable office. His wordes are receiued of the people with a great applauſe: And at the ende therof they do all diſcend from off the high ſeat or ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and do place the Duke before the high altar, where laying his hand vpon the Goſpell, he doth binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by ſolemne oth to God &amp; to his commonwealth, that he will not omit the performance of any ſuch thing as the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is bound vnto by the lawes. This being done, the Electors (that hitherto remained with the Duke doe all depart, he mounteth vp into a pulpit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9073:39"/>
of wood, taking with him one of his kinſemen, ſuch as ofall other he holdeth deereſt: which pulpit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, ſuch as are beſt eſteemed, doe take vppon their ſhoulders, and with a great ſhoute and ioy doe carry the Duke ſitting therein throughout the whole place of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> who from out the pulpit throweth money coined in his owne name round about him. There is no certaine ſumme herein limited, but euen according as the ſubſtance of the Duke may beare, the ſame being wholly referred to his diſpoſition and pleaſure: but once, the people be not negligent in gathering it vppe. At length hauing gone about the place, when they come before the ſtaires of the princes pallace, they there ſtay the pulpit, and the prince deſcendeth out. The apparell which the Duke weareth, and likewiſe a ſiluer potte, in which the money ſo throwen about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people was kept, belongeth by an auncient cuſtome vnto the mariners, that did ſo beare the Duke vpon their ſhoulders. The Duke mounting vp the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the pallace, is there receiued of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and there by them crowned with the foreſaid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is as it were the Dyadem or ornament of the Prince. This is the order of the whole pompe. The day following the Senate is aſſembled in the Court, and the Duke maketh an oration, giuing thankes to God, &amp; to the fathers for this aduancement and honour which he had receiued, promiſing withall, that his diligence &amp; trauaile ſhal neuer be ſpared for the commonwealths commodity. The like oration hee maketh before the whole aſſembly of citizens in the firſt ſeſſions that is held after his creation.</p>
            <p>Hauing now ſufficiently ſpoken of the Duke or prince
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9073:40"/>
of our commonwealth, it remaining that briefly wee ſpeake ſomewhat concerning the Counſellors, to the end that you may vnderſtand what their authority is, and how farre it extendeth.</p>
            <p>There are alwaies (as I ſaid before) ſixe Counſellors <note place="margin">The office &amp; authority of the 6. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors.</note>preſent by the princes ſide, out of euery quarter of the citie one: for the whole citie is diuided into ſixe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or tribes: three of the which are on this ſide of the great channell, which diuideth the citie, and three on the other: out of each of theſe quarters is choſen one counſellor in the ſeſſions, according to the manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed in the choyce of other magiſtrates. Their office continueth onely eight monethes, in which ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Prince they take care of all ſuch affaires as pertain to the commonwealth. But the whole maner &amp; handling of the ſeſſions, an auncient ordinance paſſeth chiefly through their hands. Likewiſe if report is to be made vnto the great councell of any matter, and by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therof to be confirmed, they are to make report thereof, as thoſe to whoſe authority that right only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, yet ſomtimes the Preſidents of the 40. are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who otherwiſe were inſufficient &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power to make report ouer to the councell. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiſtrate (the Duke onely alwaies excepted) hath this authority. They may likewiſe (if it pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) make report of any thing to the Senate or the tenne men: but the charge of aſſembling the Senate, and reporting to the ſame chiefly belongeth to the Preconſultors, like as the office of the Preſidentes of the tenne is to aſſemble the tenne, &amp; to make report vnto them: the manner of which ſhall hereafter be more largely handled. But the Councellors are endued with greater priuiledge, as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9073:40"/>
thoſe that haue in the ſenate equall authority with the Preconſultors, and in the courtes of the tenne men, with the preſidentes of that Court: for the ſpace of eyght monthes they are alwaies preſent with the Duke: and do exerciſe theſe offices of which I haue made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But foure monthes they are preſent or rather Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentes of the fortie men, who haue the handling of waightie and capitall matters, which are by their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decided &amp; determined of, as ſhall hereafter more plainly be declared. Now ſeeing that which concernes the great councell, which repreſenteth in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth popular eſtate, and that likewiſe of the prince, which beareth the perſon of a king, is handled of vs, though vneloquently, yet faithfully, &amp; with diligence, the vndertaken worke ſeemeth to require at my hands, that I ſhould likewiſe ſpeake of the other partes &amp; bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this gouernment, which in ſeeming doe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the rule &amp; gouernment of the nobles and beſt citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, ſeeing that eſpecially the ſame doth in the city of <hi>Venice</hi> excell the reſt: as in the following volume I will by Gods help, make manifeſt and plaine.</p>

Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Politiques moſt wiſely ſaith, that in euery commonwealth which wold emulate and follow the wiſedome &amp; policie of nature, olde men ſhould be placed at the helme, and the office of the young men ſhould bee to obey and to execute thoſe thinges, which the olde men ſhould commande them. Neither can the young men, ſeeing this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neareſt vnto Nature, by any meanes finde fault
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9073:41"/>
or repine at the gouernment of olde men, or ſtirre vppe therefore any ſedition in the commonwealth: ſeeing that in this difference which age onely maketh, enuie hath no place, neyther may there iuſtly bee any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, ſo long as the young men ſhall aſſuredly hope to receiue the like obedience in their age, of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing younger ſort: which opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all commonwealthes that euer were of any fame, who alwaies preferred the counſell of the elder ſort, as <note place="margin">The name of ſenate deriued from Senes ſignifieth olde men.</note>well in the gouernment of their Cittie, as in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of their other publike affaires, neither is the name of ſenate from elſe where deriued, then from old men, who in the Latine tong are called <hi>Senes.</hi> I woulde alleadge heere the commonwealth of the Romaines, of the Athenians, of the Carthaginians, of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, beſides the lawes of ſundry other cities, but that the matter is of it ſelfe ſo manifeſt, that it ſtandeth not in need of any ſuch proofe.</p>
            <p>With this reaſon therefore was the Senate ordayned and eſtabliſhed in this commonwealth of ours, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the councell of the tenne, who in the cittie of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> in whoſe commonwealth (as I ſaid) there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the three gouernments royall, popular, &amp; noble, do repreſent the ſtate of the nobilitie, &amp; are (as it were) the meane or middle, which reconcileth and bindeth together the two extreames, that is, the popular eſtate repreſented in the great councell, &amp; the prince bearing a ſhew of royaltie. So ſaith <hi>Plato</hi> are the extreame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the earth and the fire, ioyned and bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the middle elementes, as in a well tuned dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſon the extreame voyces are concorded together by the middle tunes of the Dyateſſaron and Diapente.</p>

               <note place="margin">The number of right and lawfull ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are 120.</note> To go forward therefore with my purpoſe, the ſenate of <hi>Venice</hi> hath a hundred and twenty lawfull ſenators, beſides many other magiſtrates that do alſo obtaine the priuiledge and right of Senators, ſo that now in this time of ours there are aboue two hundred and twentie that haue the authority of vſing their ſuffrages in the ſenate. The lawfull Senators are euery yeare created by that aſſembly of citizens, which (as I haue often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is tearmed the great Councell: Neyther hath this honour any vacation, as the other magiſtrates haue, but they may if their lot fall out, and that the great councell bee therewith pleaſed (which for the moſt parte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth) continue euery yeare in that office. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and meane of their election is of vs before declared, when wee expreſſed the forme of the whole ſeſſions. There are in the monthes of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi> in euery ſeſsion ſixe Senators elected: which ſeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe ſeſſions tenne times remoued, make vp the number of threeſcore elected Senators, the other threeſcore are ioyned, or (as it were) aſcribed to the former, and they all are choſen together at certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſeſſions. For vpon the nine &amp; twentieth day of <hi>September,</hi> the ſenate doth aſſemble, &amp; then euery ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and other that hath authority of ſuffrages, nameth a citizen in the Senate. And the next day early at three a clocke in the morning, the whole number of citizens commeth into the ſeſſion houſe, and then the names being rehearſed by the Secretary of all thoſe citizens, who the day before were named of the Senators, the names of all are put into a potte, and afterwardes taken out by chaunce. By and by they go to their lottes, of which threeſcore of thoſe that ſhall haue moſt lottes in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9073:42"/>
their fauour (ſo that they exceed not the halfe) are that yeare aſcribed in the number of Senators, but yet in that ſort that there may not bee in that laſt number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two of a kindred: ſo that in the whole number of lawfull Senators, there cannot in all be aboue three of a kindred, which ordinance ſeemeth to haue beene eſtabliſhed with exceeding wiſedome in behalfe of the commonwealth: conſidering that there cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a commonwealth a more daungerous or peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contagion, then the ouerweighing of one parte or faction aboue the other: for where the ballance of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſtandeth not euen, it is vnpoſſible that there ſhould bee a friendly ſocietie and firme agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the citizens: which alwaies happeneth where many offices of the commonwealth meete together in one. For as euery mixture diſſolueth, if any one of the elementes (of which the mixed body conſiſteth) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the other: and as in muſicke the tune is marred where one ſtring keepeth a greater noyſe then hee ſhoulde doe: ſo by the like reaſon, if you will haue your commonwealth perfect and enduring, let not one parte bee mightier then the other, but let them all (in as much as may bee) haue equall ſhare in the publique authoritie. With excellent wiſedome and prouidence therefore did our aunceſtors cauſe this to bee eſtabliſhed as a perpetuall law and decree in our commonwealth, that not onely in the ſenate, but alſo in all other offices there ſhoulde not bee any more of one kindred or allyance, then the preſeruation of equalitie required. Neyther ſeemeth the order of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Senate inuented with leſſe forecaſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is that threeſcore citizens ſhould bee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9073:43"/>
choſen, according to the accuſtomed vſe of the ſeſſions, chaunce, election and iudgement, being therein min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled altogether, but that the choyce of the other three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore ſhould bee after another ſorte, ſuch as you haue heard, wherein chaunce hath no force at all: for if in them all chance ſhould haue borne ſway, it might eaſily haue happened, that the principall citizens might haue beene left out, to the great preiudice of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. They ordayned therefore that there ſhoulde yearely be choſen threeſcore fathers, not by caſualty of <note place="margin">The laſt 60. ſenators which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led adiunctes.</note>lottes, but by ſoundneſſe of iudgement. So you ſee that the Senate firſt conſiſteth of a hundred and twenty, of which threeſcore are by their proper tearme, called Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, the reſt, Adiuncts: in the ſeſſion of whoſe choice, there is commonly a whole day paſſed ouer. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this hundred and twenty lawfull Senators, thoſe of the councell of tenne haue in the Senate equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the Senators, as alſo beſide the Duke and the other councellors, the councell of the fortie haue the like, the iudges of capitall &amp; waighty crimes, the maiſters ouer the ſalt and corne, and the procurers of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> beſides many others: ſo that in our time their number exceedeth two hundred &amp; twenty, who in their offices haue all the power and authority of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators. The whole manner of the commonwealths go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment belongeth to the ſenate. That which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate determineth is held for ratified and inuiolable. By <note place="margin">The great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note>their authority and aduiſe is peace confirmed and war denounced. The whole rents and receipts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comwealth are at their appointment collected and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in, and likewiſe laid out againe and defrayed. If there be any new taxations or ſubſidies to be laid vpon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9073:43"/>
the citizens, they are impoſed, &amp; likewiſe leuied by the Senates decree. And if at any time it ſhall ſeeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of the commonwealth, to create a new officer or magiſtrate vpon any ſodaine vrgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he is by the ſenate elected. Beſides, the ſenate by a perpetuall prerogatiue, hath authority to chuſe ſuch Embaſſadors as are to bee ſent to forraine princes, and likewiſe to create the colledge of thoſe, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to aſſemble the ſenate, and to report vnto them. Thoſe are of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tearmed <hi>Praeconſultores,</hi> but wee <note place="margin">Preconſultors or Sages.</note>honouring them with a prouder title, do call them <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which name wee muſt in this diſcourſe often vſe, leaſt otherwiſe I ſhoulde ſeeme to miſlike of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe of ſpeaking. Neuertheleſſe theſe ſeſſions of the ſenate, in which both the Ambaſſadors and the Sages are elected, ſtand nothing ſo much in the arbiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of chaunce, as thoſe before deſcribed, that is to ſay, the great councels, wherein the whole number of the citizens is aſſembled &amp; gathered together: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the ſenators nameth one whom hee thinketh good, and then go to their ſuffrages, of which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall haue more then the reſt, prouided alwayes, that he haue about the halfe of the whole number on his ſide, is preſently ratified and choſen, And if at any time the ſeruice &amp; neceſſary occaſion of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſeeme to require the employment of ſome one in an office, which they thinke he would be vnwilling to accept, then doth euery one of the ſenators ſecretly in a little ſcrol note the name of him whom he thinketh fit for the charge, putting the ſame into a pot prouided ready for the purpoſe, after which the Secretary taketh thoſe ſcrolles out, and readeth them all openly: &amp; then
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9073:44"/>
againe they go for euery one of thoſe to their lottes, of which on whomſoeuer the greateſt part doth fal, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pronounced choſen: prouided alwaies that hee haue more then halfe of the whole number. This manner of writing in ſcrolles was inuented, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome might refrain from naming him whom they thought fitte for gouernment and diſcharge of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: leaſt in regarde of his vnwillingneſſe to accept it, they might thereby incurre his diſpleaſure &amp; euill will, whereby through a priuate regard the common good might receiue preiudice.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vſeth in their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> Now it remaineth that we declare the manner that the Senate vſeth in determining, decreeing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting vpon thoſe thinges which are to bee done: and in what ſort the decrees of the Senate were wont to be executed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sixteene Sages elected.</note> Our elders were not ignorant, that if euery Senator ſhould confuſedly make report vnto the Senate, &amp; then deliuer his opinion without limitation or reſtriction of that office to ſome particulars: there muſt of neceſſity follow a great trouble and intricateneſſe in the Senate. Beſides, it is by experience approoued, that the thing which dependeth generally alike vpon the care of all, is generally alike in a manner of all neglected.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was by our lawes ordained, that there ſhoulde bee choſen ſixteene citizens out of the ſenate, which in reſpect of their farther knowledge and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency aboue the reſt, are of the common ſort called <hi>Sages,</hi> we imitating <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in regarde that they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult afore hand among themſelues &amp; then to councell the ſenate in thoſe thinges that are to be handled) may well call them Preconſultors. Theſe haue authority to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9073:44"/>
aſſemble the ſenate, and to make relation of each mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto them. This magiſtrate doeth not continue in <note place="margin">The Sages di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into three ſorts or orders.</note>office any longer then ſixe monthes. But now theſe Sages are diuided into three ſortes, of great difference and diuerſity the one from the other: for in the firſt are ſixe ſenators of the moſt noble and citizens, excelling the reſt as well in dignity and eſtimation, as in prudent grauity and profoundneſſe of knowledge. Their office principally is, that in waighty and important cauſes concerning the ſtate of the commonwealth as well in matter of warres, as in thinges of peace, they are firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues to hold a long and deliberate conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and then to giue ouer their councell and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſenate. In the ſecond ſort or order are onely fiue, who though they haue equall authoritie with the other, in making report of all thinges to the ſenate, yet are they of farre leſſe eſtimation and dignity. To them chiefly belongeth the care of the ſoldiers that are by the commonwealth entertayned in pay, and are vnder the gouernment of the Generall of the Venetian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Of the third order there are alſo fiue to whom the charge of all ſea matters is committed, of which onely and of nothing els they haue authority to make report vnto the ſenate. This office was held of our anceſtors in great reputation, during the while that our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth did flouriſh &amp; was famous in matters of nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when once our minds were bent to the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our limites, and to the greatneſſe of rule by lande: then beganne our ſeafaring matters to decline, and with them the reputation of this office, ſo that in this age of ours, young men and ſome in a manner beardleſſe are admitted thereunto. Theſe ſixteene ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9073:45"/>
therefore, whoſe aſſembly among the Venetians by proper terme called, the Colledge, doe early in the morning meet together with the prince and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, &amp; firſt they ſpend the day till it be three a clocke, in giuing audience to priuate ſutors, that haue any cauſe eyther with the commonwealth or with any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular magiſtrate, whoſe ſuits and cauſes they do there altogether determine and end, vnleſſe the matter bee of ſuch importance, that it behooueth them to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof vnto the ſenate.</p>
            <p>After three a clocke all priuate men are diſmiſſed out of the court, &amp; preſently all ſuch letters as are ſent vnto the ſenate are read by one of the ſecretaries that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the ſtate: after which the Sages or Preconſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do withdraw themſelues apart into a Conclaue or councell chamber, there to conſult of publike buſines, vnleſſe they be detayned by the Ambaſſadors of ſome Prince, that deſireth audience of the Duke &amp; the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or by ſome other buſineſſe of great and waighty moment.</p>
            <p>After that they are withdrawen &amp; placed euery one in his ſeate: he which there preſideth (which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue each of them inioyeth ſeuen dayes together, one after the other as his turne comes about) propoundeth that cauſe or matter, which they are in councell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of. Then he demandeth of euery one his opinion, yet obſeruing ſuch order, that thoſe of the firſt ſort, as they are nobleſt in degree, ſo they bee firſt intreated to ſpeake their aduiſe, and after them the other fiue, whom wee placed in the ſecond ranke or order. Laſtly if the queſtion concerne any ſea matters, the five of the laſt order, who haue charge therof are asked their opinion.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9073:45"/>
But if the matter propounded doe not pertaine to ſea buſineſſe, they are to holde their peace. In each ranke or order hee alwayes firſt ſpeaketh his aduiſe, that had the Preſidencie the laſt ſeuen daies, and then next vnto him the eldeſt of the company, and after him the reſt accordingly vnto their age. Laſtly of all, he which did propound the matter, &amp; ſitteth during thoſe ſeuen daies as Preſident and chiefe, vttereth his conceipt. The matter being at length well diſputed of among them: whether they be all of one opinion or diuided into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry (as the diſpoſitions of men are different and diuers) they go firſt to the prince &amp; councel, before they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſenate: &amp; there do repeate the ſeuerall opinions of all, to which if the prince or any of the counſellors doe ſeeme to leane or giue his aſſent, or ſhall otherwiſe of himſelfe yeeld any other different reaſon, the matter is then once againe debated of among them, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery mans opinion put in writing, which belongeth to thoſe to doe that are ſecretaries of this three ſeuerall orders. The buſineſſe then being well debated of, that is to be determined by authority of the Senate, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is aſſembled.</p>
            <p>When the ſenators are come into the Court, firſt all ſuch letters as are of moment, and were deliuered to the Duke and Sages ſince the diſmiſſing of the laſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, are there recited. Then are the opinions of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges repeated concerning thoſe matters that were in their Colledge debated, whether they were all of one mind or of ſundry, euen in a manner in the ſame ſort, as the requeſtes of the people, of which <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh, were wont to be among the Athenians. But none other beſides thoſe, who (as I told you) are of the Venetians
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9073:46"/>
called Sages, hath power or authority to make report vnto the ſenate, and then to confirme &amp; eſtabliſh his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion by authority of that order: alwaies I accept the Duke, the counſellors and the Preſidents of the forty, of whom I will at large declare, and ſpeake more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The opinions of all being read and peruſed in the ſenate, he that is for that weeke preſident of the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sages, ariſeth if he ſo thinke good: if not the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt or els any of the other, to whom being deſirous to ſpeake, the reſt are contented to giue place, and from a ſeate or ſcaffold made of purpoſe ſomewhat higher then the reſt, hee maketh his oration to the ſenate: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging ſuch reaſons as hee thinketh meeteſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his opinion, and to refute that which is maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the contrary, yet modeſtly, and with grauity, as it beſeemeth a ſenate of ſo honourable a degree and order. After that he hath ended, another of the Sages that differeth from his opinion, ariſeth, fortifying his owne aduiſe with the beſt reaſons hee can yeelde, and refelling the former, and likewiſe the reſt, if there bee any more that doe diſagree from his. Then the third, (if there bee ſo many diuerſities of cenſures among them) ſtandeth vp, by proofes and argumentes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring to maintayne and confirme that which he thinketh meete and conuenient: and ſo by courſe ſtill is the matter pleaded and argued among them, till there remaine not any one more that will ſpeake: as for the Senators no one of them may ſpeake, till the Sages that will take the matter vpon them, haue made an ende: but when they haue with reaſons, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and proofes contended and throughly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9073:46"/>
the matter of each ſide as much as ſhall ſeeme good vnto them, then haue the other Senators alſo libertie to ſpeake: of which if any will gaineſay or confirme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former opinions, or alleadge any new of his owne, he may freely do it at his pleaſure: though as for the opinion of which himſelfe ſhall bee author and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentor, he may not himſelfe make report thereof vnto the Senate: but if it ſhalbe thought good and profitable for the commonwealth, then commonly one of the Colledge, or a counſellor, or the Preſident of the forty relateth the ſame vnto the Senate. By which means the matter being at length wel &amp; throughly ſifted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: then doth the ſenate determine by the ſuffrages of thoſe that are of that order, whether of the opinions is to be allowed: yet do they not with words or ſignes confirme or refute that opinion, as we reade the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romaines did, neyther do they ſpeake it publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for euery one to heare: but their manner is to decide it with pots and ſuffrages, not much vnlike the order I told you was obſerued in the Seſſions.</p>
            <p>The ſecretaries of the ſenate bring forth as many pottes as there are opinions concerning the matter debated of, and one beſides which is greene, into which are put the lottes of all thoſe that do diſlike that aduice and counſell: and another redde, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the balles of thoſe Senators, that remaine doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to whether opinion they ſhoulde encline. The other Senators euery one putteth his ball into his pot whoſe opinion he liketh and eſteemeth aboue the reſt: if hee like none at all then he putteth it into the greene potte, and if hee bee doubtfull, into the redde. The Counſellors do tell the balles, and that opinion is held
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9073:47"/>
for ratification and decreed, which ſhall haue in fauour thereof the balles of halfe the ſenators, which number if none of them attaine vnto: then firſt, that opinion which is fauoured with feweſt balles, is quite reiected, &amp; for the reſt they go to their lots againe: and ſo in that maner ſtil reiecting that which hath feweſt bals, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is at length brought onely betweene two, of which the one muſt of neceſſity haue aboue halfe the ſuffrages, and then the ſame is by the decree of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate authorized and allowed. One matter being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, they beginne with another (vnleſſe it bee too late in the day) alwaies obſeruing the ſame manner as is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner of giuing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</note> If there come an Ambaſſador from any prince to the commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> he is receyued of the Duke, the counſellors and the whole colledge, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them expreſſe his ambaſſage: which being hearde, they do for that time diſmiſſe him, demanding ſpace to conſult vpon the matter, which hauing done in ſort &amp; forme as you haue heard, they then demand the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Senate. To which the Duke firſt declareth the effect of the Ambaſſadors demande, and then the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are read of all thoſe that haue authoritie to make report to the ſenate, &amp; finally in manner as before. The ſenate determineth what aunſwere ſhall bee made vnto the Ambaſſadors demand: who being called in, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary readeth vnto him the decree of the Senate, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hee is diſmiſſed. This is in effect the whole ſumme, manner, and forme that the Senate vſeth in <note place="margin">The councel or colledge of the tenne.</note>their conſultations, decrees and councels: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I thinke it requiſite in this place to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the councell of the tenne, of which you haue
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9073:47"/>
often heard me make mention. This councell or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the tenne is among the Venetians of great and eminent authority, and of which any man may boldly ſay, that the whole ſafetie of the commonwealth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth. I will therefore touch the beginning and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall thereof, to the ende that the whole manner and courſe of the ſame may be the eaſilyer conceyued. Our elders did with a maruellous &amp; in manner diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence foreſee, that as in mans bodie, through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and putrefaction of one humor, many &amp; moſt daungerous diſeaſes doe commonly happen, which growe in time to bee the cauſes of death: ſo alſo in a commonwealth there are ſometime wicked and diſloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all citizens, that are cauſes thereunto of great troubles and calamities, whiles they aſpire rather to the pride of a wicked and vniuſt commandement, then to the praiſe of an honeſt and quiet obedience: carried away in thoſe damnable endeuors eyther with ambition, and deſire of rule, or oppreſſed with intollerable debt, or otherwiſe hauing committed ſome haynous wickednes or crime, for which they ſtand in doubt of puniſhment: ſuch as we reade was in <hi>Rome, Cateline, Silla, Marius,</hi> and finally <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> who hauing by tyranny gotten the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, did (in a manner) bring it to vtter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruine. The like we reade of ſundry common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes <note place="margin">Sundry great and famous common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by the infidelity &amp; ambition of ſome their priuate citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</note>of the Greekes, yea and thoſe ſometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and of great glory, which by the vndermining ambition and treachery of ſome their wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull citizens, were brought into ſeruitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. But in theſe times of ours <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelfe hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs ſufficient examples, all the cities whereof (in a manner) that were eyther gouerned by the people, or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9073:48"/>
by the nobility, being brought vnder the yoke or tirany of ſomeone of their citizens. For which cauſe our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent elders laboured to eſtabliſh this commonwealth of ours in all perfection and beauty, and to ſtrengthen the ſame with ſuch &amp; ſo holeſome lawes, that it might as much as in mans wiſedome lyeth, preuent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of ſo monſtrous and miſerable a fall: for they <note place="margin">Nothing more to be feared then inteſtine broiles and cauil diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>imagined that there was not any thing ſo much to bee doubted and feared, as an inteſtine enemy, or ciuill ſtrife &amp; ſedition among the citizens. Calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to minde, that among the Lacedemonians the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phores were mighty and of great authority, and among the Athenians the Areopagites, and ſo likewiſe among the Romaines the Decemuiri or tenne men, inſomuch <note place="margin">The cauſe of the creation of ten in the city of Venice.</note>that they made lawes: they thought it not amiſſe by imitation of their example, though in an vnlike cauſe, to create in this our citie ſome magiſtrate of authority and power, whoſe office aboue all other things ſhould be, to haue eſpeciall care to ſee that among the citizens ſhould not ariſe any ſtrife or diſſention, whereby there might enſue any ſcandall or vprore: and to preuent factions, or the attemptes of any wicked citizen that ſhoulde conſpire againſt the liberty of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: of which ſort of miſchiefe if there ſhould by euill deſtiny, any creepe into the commonwealth, they then to haue abſolute authority to puniſh and chaſten the ſame, leaſt otherwiſe the commonwealth might thereby receiue harme.</p>
            <p>But ſo great an authority and puiſſance coulde not haue beene committed to few without danger, neither if to many, woulde it then haue been formidable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to auoide the one and the other inconuenience,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9073:48"/>
they ordayned and eſtabliſhed this Colledge of tenne. They continue in this office a yeare, and haue adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them the Duke and the ſixe Counſellors, ſo that the whole Colledge commeth to make vp the iuſt number of ſeuenteene citizens, to whome this great power and authoritie is giuen. Of theſe tenne there are three euery month choſen and elected by lotte, who are Preſidentes of the Colledge, and <note place="margin">The heads of the Tenne.</note>by common phraſe of ſpeech called the heades of the tenne, and they haue authority to aſſemble the whole Colledge of the tenne, and to make report vnto them. They haue aparte by themſelues a chamber, wherein they aſſemble when they ſitte in councell. They haue alſo vnder them priuate and particular officers, as Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Vſhers, and certayne that are allowed for their garde. So that there is not any other Tribunall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates gone vnto with greater obſeruaunce and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie. Thither reſort allthoſe that haue any thing to do in their Colledge. They likewiſe reade all letters written to the Colledge, and make report of them to the ſame, for doing of the which with the greater ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, one of thoſe Preſidents alone by himſelfe hath not authority to make report, but they muſt bee eyther two to make reporte of the ſame matter, or els foure Councellors. For the ſame cauſe alſo and to auoide the raſhneſſe and temeritie that ſome fewe of them might otherwiſe vſe in alteration of any thing, it is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if they will cancell or vndoe any thing that is already eſtabliſhed and fully confirmed, they muſt at leaſt haue the Suffrages of two partes of the Colledge, for confirmation of that which they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9073:49"/>
ſhall doe, which otherwiſe is helde to bee voide and of no effect. They haue alſo an order that the offendor is <note place="margin">The offender neuer ſuffred to come into the Colledge, not any friend or Lawyer to plead for him.</note>neuer ſuffred to come into the colledge, when they are to giue iudgement of him, nor any friend, kinſeman, or Lawyer for him to pleade his cauſe: which priuiledge is granted to offendors in any other court whatſoeuer, where their cauſe is handled. The manner vſed in their iudgements is in this ſort: The offendor is examined of the Preſidents of the colledge, and his confeſſion writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; then the matter is reported to the Colledge, the preſidents of which &amp; the other Iudges that are preſent do plead as well in the behalf of the accuſer as of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor neuer determining of any great matter, but with an exceeding moderation of iudgement. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the charge onely of preuenting and remedying all ſuch things as any way ſhould offend the ciuil agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the commonwealth, was committed to the care of the tenne. But afterwardes certaine other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous &amp; enormous offences, as making of falſe money, ſodomie, and ſuch like were alſo brought vnder the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity and cenſure of this ſharpe and ſtricte manner of iudgement. And in theſe times of ours this authority of the tenne hath yet much more enlarged his bounds: for they haue power giuen them to ſet amercements vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry offences, and to puniſh thoſe that ſhall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the name of God, or of the bleſſed Virgine: and it is likewiſe or dayned, that whatſoeuer ſecrete matters that ſhould concerne the ſtate of the commonwealth any way: that ſuch (I ſay) ſhould bee brought and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed vnto them: who neuertheleſſe do not determine any thing of great moment without the opinion of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9073:49"/>
Senate. To the end therefore that a few citizens ſhould not alone haue ſuch ſucceſſiue authority in ſo waighty affaires, there are called and admitted into this colledge the Sages of the firſt and ſeconde order: likewiſe the <note place="margin">Fifteen ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors aſcribed to the colledge of the ten, who are called Adiunctes.</note>Aduocators and procurers of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> whoſe office is held in great eſtimation and reuerence. There are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides fifteene Senators aſcribed to this Colledge, who are called Adiunctes, but all theſe here rehearſed haue not the priuiledge of ſuffrage, but onely the ſeuenteen firſt, and theſe fifteene Adiunctes: ſo that the whole number of thoſe that haue authority of ſuffrage are two &amp; thirty. The reſt are depriued of this power and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though otherwiſe they be preſent at all their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. The fifteene Adiunctes were not accuſtomed to be elected neyther of the Senate, neyther of the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the great Councell, but the tenne men did of themſelues make choyce of fifteene ſuch Senators as they beſt liked for their aſſiſtantes and companions: though now the ſame is altered, and the fifteene are choſen by the ſeſſions of the great Councell, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiſtrates are. That there hath great vtilitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> through this councell &amp; Colledge of tenne: experience it ſelfe hath made moſt manifeſt &amp; plaine. For two hundred &amp; ten yeares ſince <hi>Marino Phalerio</hi> that then was Duke, hauing turned all his thoughtes to tiranny and vſurpation, was likely to haue giuen a great &amp; deadly blow to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Marino Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerio Duke of Venice, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note>of our commonwealth, if by the graue authority &amp; wiſedome of the tenne, he had not beene oppreſſed &amp; put downe, and receiued the rewarde of his impiety &amp; wickedneſſe: for by their iudgement and ſentence, hee had his head publiquely ſtricken off, and with him ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9073:50"/>
other citizens of great nobility, that together with him had conſpired the ruine of their countries libertie, and beſides his memory was deliuered to poſterity with an eternall blot of diſhonour and infamy: For in thoſe places where the pictures of our princes are curiouſly ſet forth and painted, with Epitaphes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunces of thoſe vertuous deedes, which they haue done in the behalfe and ſeruice of their countrey, the ſeate of <hi>Marino Phalerio</hi> is left bare without any picture at all, ſaue onely a few verſes, ſignifying vnto the reader, that this Duke was for his offences (becauſe I will not vary the wordes as they ſtand written) ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the axe: a conſpiracie without doubt of paſſing wickedneſſe, and exceeding daunger, in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance not vnlikely to haue wrought the vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the commonwealth, if by the authority of the colledge of ten, the ſame had not beene preſently extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Likewiſe ſundry other citizens, that being tickled with this rumor of ambition, had publiſhed certaine plauſible lawes, to draw vnto them the good willes of the people, were ouertaken by the authority of this colledge, &amp; preſently cut off: whereby it is come to paſſe, that through the power of this Colledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies aſſiſted by the goodneſſe of God, no ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious infection hath as yet beene able to eate into our commonwealth. Thus the principal partes of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealthes are by vs already expreſſed, but now to the end that our vndertaken work may be in euery part perfect and accompliſhed, we will ſpeake ſomewhat of the remaining magiſtrates, as well thoſe, to whoſe handes is committed the adminiſtration of iuſtice, as thoſe that haue the handling &amp; ordering of the publike

rents, and withall of the manner of gouerning thoſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are vnder the Venetian commonwealth, as alſo of their captaines, nauies &amp; armies, both by ſea and by land. Laſtly I will make mention of certaine ſtatutes &amp; ordinances, by which the danger of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples miſlike, in that they alſo haue not part in gouerning the commonwealth is cleerly auoided, with their great ſatisfaction and contentment: I will likewiſe ſhew, that the training and exerciſing the youthes to the exerciſes of warre is not in the Citie neglected, as ſome ſuppoſe. But before I proceed farther to theſe particular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, I thinke it not beſide the purpoſe to aduertiſe the reader, that in this manner of the Senates conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which I haue ſpoken, and likewiſe in that of the Colledge of Tenne, there doth plainely appeare a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mixture of the lawes of a popular ſtate, with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a nobilitie. For whereas the ſenate cannot deliberate of any thing if firſt report therof be not made vnto them of the Sages, therein appeareth a ſtate of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: but that the Sages haue not any power, vnleſſe they conſult with the Senate, and haue by authority thereof, their opinions confirmed, taſteth altogether of a popular gouernment, ſo that this iuſt mixture &amp; temperature, which maketh the perfect meaſures and meanes of gouernment to be vnited in the true forme and ſhape of a commonwealth, is founde not onely in the whole body together, but alſo in euery parte and particular member of this our commonwealth. But returning whence I digreſſed: I will firſt of all handle that part which pertayneth and belongeth vnto Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>All right &amp; iuſtice therfore which is wont to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9073:51"/>
of magiſtrates, is diuided into two parts, for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it conſiſteth in the puniſhmentes of lewde &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, that ſhall in any notable ſorte treſpaſſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt God, and traiterouſly againſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or wickedly againſt any citizen, or member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in particular: or els it concerneth the iudgement and determination of litigious controuerſies and ciuill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <note place="margin">Criminall and ciuill iudges.</note>Therefore are there alſo in <hi>Venice</hi> two kindes of Iudges, the one ſeruing for the deciſion of ciuill cauſes, the other for the iudgement of capital crimes, of whom we will firſt ſpeake, and then of the other.</p>
            <p>Some offences are eſteemed to be ſmall and light, in regard of the proper nature of the offence, or els of the condition of him that offended: others are accounted to be more grieuous and of greater importance, eyther through the qualitie of the miſdeede it ſelfe, or els through the nobility and degree of him that doth it: whence it commeth that theſe capitall iudges are alſo diuided into two: the one for matters of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grieuous enormity: the other for crimes leſſe haynous and of ſmaller waight: which diuiſion of iudgements as it was firſt ordained with an exceeding reaſon and founde foundation, ſo hath experience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued it for allowable &amp; of high commendation: we will firſt ſpeake of the chiefeſt, and then of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe offences, which we told you were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cenſure of the tenne: all other great and waightie crimes, being by the Aduocators reported of, and by the Colledge of fortie well pondered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, are wont all to be determined, and punniſhment according to the qualitie of the crime to bee inflicted vpon thoſe that ſhalbe found faulty therein. Theſe forty
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9073:51"/>
that haue the examination &amp; handling of waighty cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall cauſes, are commonly called the xl. criminall Iudges: we will ſpeake of eyther, but we will firſt begin with the Aduocators.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The office of the Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note>The office of the Aduocators was in times paſſed in great authoritie and maruelous eſtimation: the duety and function therereof being to defend the lawes pure and inuiolate, without ſuffring them in any one point <note place="margin">The Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in Venice reſemble the auncient Tribunes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine people.</note>ro be blemiſhed, ſo that their authority and power is much like vnto that of the Tribunes of the Romaine people, but that they were to defend the liberty of the people, and ours onely the force of the lawes: ſo that in my iudgement they may, and not vnfitly be tearmed the Tribunes of the lawes. But we to auoide all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities, will ſtill retaine the common and accuſtomed worde: they onely pleaded and made report vnto the people, but ours to the xl. men for ſmall cauſes, for greater to the Senate, for greateſt of all to the greater Councell, if ſo they ſhall thinke good: ſo that in aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time the anthority of this office was paſſing hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But now ſince the mightineſſe and encreaſed greatneſſe of the Tenne, this office is growen to bee of leſſe account, and the eſtimation thereof much obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Neuertheleſſe ſeeing there belongeth to this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſo ample an authority of reporting in all cauſes, but eſpecially the guarding and defending of the lawes: &amp; ſeeing that thoſe which haue committed any exceſſe or crime, ſeeme to haue broken and tranſgreſſed the lawes, it ſeemed good that thoſe offences ſhould in a certaine peculiar ſort bee corrected by the cenſure of the Aduocators, though of themſelues they haue not any authority of determining any thing abſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9073:52"/>
the offendors, vnleſſe it be in ſome ſmall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the reſt are all ordered by the ſentence of the Councell.</p>
            <p>In this place, I thinke it not from the purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane <note place="margin">The manner of capitall iudgements.</note>the manner and meane of capitall iudgements, which are giuen vpon the reporte of the Aduocators, ſeeing that (vnleſſe I be deceyued) the like cuſtome is not any where obſerued, withall I ſhall thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and plainlier make you vnderſtand what the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is of this office of Aduocators.</p>
            <p>When any crime or offence is brought before the Aduocators (if the ſame be thought worthy of their cenſure) then preſently is he, whoſe name is brought by ſome one of them (the charge thereof belonging chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to three) declared and argued to be guiltie, and then report is thereof made ouer by him that argued him, to what councell himſelfe ſhall beſt like, though vſually ſuch matters are referred to the colledge of the xl which haue preſidence, and authority ouer capitall crimes &amp; iudgements. And there the matter beeing well debated of, the councel determineth, whether the offender ſhal be put in priſon or tortured, or otherwiſe allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his cauſe at libertie, who is either by the decree of the councell preſently ſent for, or els ſecretly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Officers and Sergeantes that attende vpon the Aduocators: and then hee is eyther at libertie, or as a priſoner examined vpon the matter: he maketh his aunſwere, and witneſſes and proofes are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on each ſide, and each particular regiſtred in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as well in the behalfe of the offendor, as againſt him, and a coppie thereof giuen him, and a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite appointed him to inſtruct his Aduocators, &amp; ſuch
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9073:52"/>
as hee ſhall chuſe to pleade for him: and they likewiſe prouide themſelues of ſuch proofes and argumentes, as may beſt ſerue for his defence, and for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and confutation of ſuch reaſons and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as ſhall be vrged againſt him, and then the matter commeth to the pleading.</p>
            <p>I cannot here ouerſlip an ancient cuſtome obſerued of our forepaſſed elders euen vnto this age of ours, which is, that if any doe want meanes and abilitie to entertayne an Aduocate or Lawyer to pleade and defende his cauſe: then are there two Aduocates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him at the charge of the commonwealth, to ſpeake and argue in the defence and maintenance of his right. For thereof the lawes haue a ſpeciall regarde, <note place="margin">Two aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the cauſe of thoſe that want meanes &amp; abilitie to entertaine them.</note>that no one doe receiue puniſhment without being firſt admitted to ſay what hee can in iuſtification of himſelfe. But after that due ceremonies are obſerued with the offendor, and all reſpectes and liberties affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that the defence of his cauſe requireth, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators doe warne the councell, and a day is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the tryall of his cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Councell being aſſembled, the accuſation of the parties that ſtande vpon their tryall, belongeth to the Aduocators, who are in that behalfe to behaue themſelues with great ſharpeneſſe, vehemence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity, euen in as inuectiue a manner (if poſſible they could attaine and reach thereunto) as that which <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> vſed againſt <hi>Verres</hi> or <hi>Antonius,</hi> yet ſo that they refrayne from vnſeemely rayling, and do not digreſſe or wander out of the matter with extremitie of ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words. For whoſoeuer maliciouſly raileth, ſeemeth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9073:53"/>
rather to bewray a mind intemperate and hatefull, then any way to aduaunce the commonwealthes cauſe. For in this point the matter is farre otherwiſe among the Venetians, then it was in times paſſed among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. Aunciently in <hi>Rome</hi> any citizen whatſoeuer might impleade another, and with all bitterneſſe accuſe him before the Iudges: but in <hi>Venice</hi> no priuate man may performe ſuch office, the ſame by the lawes of the commonwealth belonging to the dignity &amp; magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Aduocators. In which point mee thinketh our anceſtors did rightlier imitate the nature of things, and had therein a more regardfull foreſight to maintain the citizens in agreement, then had the Romaines. For ſeeing that an offence committed is a breach of the lawes, &amp; a ſcandall to the commenwealth, &amp; the lawes and the commommonwealth are to exact puniſhment thereof: who can be fitter to require the puniſhment of him that offendeth, or who ought thereunto to bend greater indeuour, then that Magiſtrate whoſe authority, rule &amp; dignity is wholly giuen him to defend the laws? Neyther can any priuate citizen play the part of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, without exceeding enuie and hatred of him whom he ſhall proſecute, whence eaſily there might ſedition &amp; trouble ariſe among the citizens, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience is by vs notably auoyded, by laying this whole charge of accuſations vpon a Magiſtrate, who is not to handle the ſame according to any priuate or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſſentious conceipt, but according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rule and forme of the lawes: ſo that it hath neuer lightly beene hearde of, that euer any blame was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an Aduocator for vſing vehement inuectiues, or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9073:53"/>
being a ſharpe accuſer, but rather the greater applauſe and praiſe thereby to ariſe vnto him among all the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. But let vs now returne to our before mentioned manner of iudgements.</p>
            <p>The Councell being aſſembled, the Aduocator plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the parte of a bitter accuſer, ſtrayning the vttermoſt inuention of his wittes with all vehemence againſt the offendor, firſt obiecting vnto him the offence, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſame with witneſſes, and then ſtrengthening his obiection with probabilities and likelihoodes of coniecture: hauing ended his ſpeech, the aduocate of the offender pleadeth in the Clyentes behalfe: After which if any of the Aduocators will ſpeake afreſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudges giue ſentence, he hath libertie ſo to do: likewiſe the Lawyers of the defendant haue leaue to aunſwere and to confute, if they can, the oppoſed argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And ſo of eyther ſide the cauſe is debated and toſſed to and fro, till eyther the offender or the Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator whoſe turne it is to ſpeake, doth declare that he hath no more to ſay, which done, the offender and his aduocates are commanded out of the Court, and the Aduocators are ſhutte into a roome apart with the Iudges and their Secretaries, not any one elſe being ſuffred to be there. The Aduocators firſt doe make a motion vnto the Iudges of puniſhing the offender, demaunding their opinions whether they thinke him worthy of puniſhment or no, not naming or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any one certayne kinde of puniſhment, which <note place="margin">Two manner of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>cuſtome was (in a manner) obſerued by the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: for in <hi>Athens</hi> the Iudges gaue two ſentences, in the firſt eyther condemning or abſoluing the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If in the firſt hee were condemned, then was the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9073:54"/>
manner of his puniſhment determined of in the ſecond, as out of <hi>Platoes</hi> Apologie of <hi>Socrates</hi> may plainly bee perceiued, the very like order of iudgement is that in manner which we do vſe: firſt (as I ſay) the aduocators make a motion vnto the Iudges of puniſhing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Then the Iudges go vnto their ſuffrages, for by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages among the Venetians all things are determined. Three pots are brought forth, by the one of which the offender is condemned: by the other hee is abſolued in maner without any correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by the third are known the opinion of thoſe, which doe ſeeme yet to doubt whether courſe is to be taken: the firſt of condemnation is white, the ſecond of abſolution greene, the third of doubtfulnes redde. Euery of the Iudges, whether the cauſe be diſputed of by the forty (as vſually it is) or els that the ſenate be conſulted with (which ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth) &amp; that only in great &amp; waighty cauſes, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by the aduocators reported ouer to the great councell, which is moſt ſeldome, &amp; neuer but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exceedingly enormous, to the ende to haue his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage vndiſcerned, letteth fall into whether of theſe <note place="margin">The manner of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners tryall.</note>three pots he pleaſeth a little linnen ball: which being done, the preſidents of the councell doe number the balles, and if more then the half be in ſauor of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners liberty, he is preſently pronounced free, &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the aduocators reiected. But if more then the half of thoſe bals, be found in the pot of condemnation, he is preſently condemned: if neither of both exceede the half, but that the greater part of the Iudges put their ſuffrages into the pot of doubtfulnes: then his cauſe is deferred ouer til another day, &amp; to the better diſcuſſion of the Iudges: if he be abſolued, he hath no more to do
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9073:54"/>
but is preſently ſet at liberty: if his terme be prolonged, then there is a new day appointed both to him and the Iudges for the handling of his cauſe: the Aduocators accuſing him and his Lawyers, as wel as they can, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the obiected crimes. After that the matter is deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; pleaded on both ſides, the Iudges go to their bals againe, and if then neyther there bee any thing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in regard that the greater part of the lots be found in the pot, that agreeth the doubtfulneſſe &amp; irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iudges, then once againe is the cauſe put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and a new day appointed both to the priſoner and the Iudges: which being come, and the Iudges caſting their lots as before, there is no farther regard helde of thoſe that are doubtfull, inſomuch that if the lottes bee not in eyther parte iuſtly equall, of neceſſitie the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt bee eyther acquitted or condemned: if hee bee acquitted, hee hath (as I ſaid before) no more to doe: but if he bee condemned, then they are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the manner of his puniſhment: concerning the which both the Aduocators and the preſidents of the Colledges of Iudges doe make motions. Alwaies <note place="margin">The office of the Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors enclyning more to ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercy. The heades of the forty and the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors propound lighter penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>the Aduocators doe propounde that puniſhment, which to that ſorte of offence doth ſeeme moſt ſharp and grieuous, their office and dutie being more to incline to ſeuerity then to mercie. The other doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome to propounde lighter penalties, vnleſſe the fault be ſo hainous, that there remain no place for pitty, or els that the Aduocators haue vſed greater lenitie then becommeth their place and office. The opinions of all being propoſed, the puniſhment that the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt ſuffer, is in the very ſame manner and faſhion concluded &amp; determined on (as I told you aboue) that the decrees of the ſenate are wont to be ratified, when
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9073:55"/>
the Sages are of ſundry &amp; diuers opinions. The manner of which if I ſhould repeat againe, I ſhould trouble the reader with a needleſſe iteration, and perchance be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted tedious for my labor: Let this ſuffiſe, that that opinion of the Iudges is pronounced and executed, which (the other being reiected) hath in fauour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more then halfe the ſuffrages.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">No one citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate allowed for an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute iudge or arbitrator in any thing.</note> Here me thinketh I ſhall not doe amiſſe to acquaint you with two ſtatutes wiſely enacted by our anceſtors.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that they would not by any meanes, that any citizen, no nor magiſtrate, ſhould bee an arbitrator without appeale in any thing, but that the ſupreme right &amp; iudgement of all things ſhoulde belong to the councels or colledges. And the other no leſſe profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the former is, that the Iudges ſhould not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their tongue pronounce their opinions: but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly by ſuffrages, the maner of which you haue heard: either of which in my opinion, grounded vpon excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reaſon: Firſt for ſo great an authority in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters, to haue been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to one magiſtrate as it had beene dangerous: ſo if now the matter fall by chaunce otherwiſe then well out, the Citie cannot find fault with any particular citizens. And with as great wiſedome was it ordained, that iudgementes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees ſhould not bee openly with ſpeech pronounced: for the Iudges by this inuention of ſecret ſuffrages doe iudge much more freely then they woulde haue done, if they had beene to deliuer their iudgementes with their tongue, in which caſe ſometimes eyther through ambition they wold haue been ſeduced from iuſtice, or els feared the offence of their well deſeruing friendes, or els doubted the indignation and miſlike of ſome greater perſon: withal this commodity ther is, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9073:55"/>
euery Iudge followeth his own iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the authority of any other Iudge: which might eaſily happen, that hee that had before ſpoken, were, reputed to be graue and wiſe, which point hath not been omitted of excellent Philoſophers: but now ſeeing the whole manner of iudgementes is of vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: wee will returne to the forty iudges of Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes, of which I had begunne to ſpeake. Their Colledge was inſtituted of our City, to the ende that the Aduocators making report vnto them of Capitall cauſes; by their deliberation, wicked men and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors might receiue condigne correction &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for vnleſſe it be in great and waightie matters, and ſuch as the commonwealthes may bee intereſſed by the deciſion of them, the Aduocators doe neuer conſult with the Senate, and verie rarely with the great Councell: but all Capitall cauſes are brought to this Colledge of the forty, whoſe ſentence is helde for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed and firme without admitting any appeale. Their office laſteth eight moneths, after that they haue before ſpent ſixteen moneths in determining of ciuill cauſes. For there are in the common wealthes of <hi>Venice</hi> three <note place="margin">The office of the forty cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall Iudges</note>Courtes or Colledges, euery one conſiſting of Forty iudges, two of them are for the iudging and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ciuile cauſes, and the thirde of which wee ſpeake for Capitall: but they are in this ſort diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that theſe forty Capitall Iudges, ſo ſoone as they haue finiſhed their lymited time of office, do returne priuately into order, and forthwith other forty are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen into their places by the ſeſſion of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and yet the forty new choſen, doe not preſently come to the iudging of Capitall cauſes, but in place
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9073:56"/>
of theſe former Capitall Iudges, doth the other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Forty ſucceede, that did in the meane ſpace of theſe eight moneths, exerciſe the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ciuile cauſes within the City. And againe in their place doth ſucceede the other Colledge of forty, which alſo in this eight moneths ſpace, had the handling of ciuil-foreyne cauſes, and in their place do ſucceed theſe laſt forty new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created, and ſo by turne they paſſe from foreyn cauſes to cauſes of the city, and laſtly to thoſe which are capital, in which iudgements, from one as I ſay to another they continue two years. Theſe three courts of iudges haue their three peculiar appellations. The firſt of forreyne cauſes is called the new Colledge, the ſecond of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuil cauſes, the old, and the third that iudgeth vpon life and death, the criminal Colledge: theſe laſt forty, beſide the high power of their iudgement in capital offences and crimes are alſo admitted into the Senate, and haue in that honorable Councell alſo their authority of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. They haue beſides three heads or preſidentes of their company, which are euery two monethes choſen new by Lot, and in their turnes they ſit with the Duke and Councellers, and haue with them equal authority of making report ouer of whatſoeuer they ſhal pleaſe, eyther to the Senate or to the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the ſame neuertheleſſe in ſuch manner as I tolde you before: neyther without reaſon are theſe forty yonger men mingled with the Senators, which are for the moſt part olde men in regarde that the heate of their nature maketh a temperature with the others coldneſſe, yet are not theſe young men equall in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the olde men, but much fewer, onely inough to put ſome heat into the cold deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Senate;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9073:56"/>
which ſomtimes exceeding &amp; in matters of ſome nature is neceſſarie. Beſides by this grant of Senator like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the forty, there may ſeeme to bee in ſome forte a communication of the commonwealths gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with the lower and meaner ſort of citizens, ſuch as for the moſt part they are that do exerciſe this office of the forty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein our aunceſters haue ſeemed to vſe &amp; obſerue a certaine kinde of popular lawe: for to euery of theſe three Colledges of forty men there is a certain rated allowance of mony appointed and giuen for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day that they ſhall aſſemble and meete, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very ſeldome do thoſe that are rich, require this office, and if they ſhould, they would as eaſily be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The honor thereof being without difficulty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the needier ſort, prouided alwaies, that their life beare with it the fame of an honeſt conuerſation: by which meanes the pouerty of meane gentlemen is not only in ſome ſort prouided for, but alſoo the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtration of the common wealth, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in ſome ſort communicated with the meaner and poorer ſorte of Citizens, as with thoſe that are highlieſt remarkable eyther for riches or nobilitie, which cuſtome hath a reference to the popular eſtate. By theſe thinges you may perceiue that there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in eueriy parte of the <hi>Venetian</hi> common wealth, that moderation, and temperature, which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this worke, I tolde you our aunceſters did ſo highly indeuour to eſtabliſh, which is, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular eſtate ſhould haue an intelligence and mixture with that of the nobilitie, yet the ſame in that order ſeaſoned, that the parts of the Nobilitie ſhould bee both
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9073:57"/>
more in number and mightier in ſway.</p>
            <p>We haue now in my opinion ſufficiently diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both of the Aduocators, as alſo of the forty crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iudges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are to that ende inſtituted, that they ſhould carefully looke into all ſuch offences as are any way notorious, eyther through the qualitie of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or the condition of the offendor: Now the time <note place="margin">Two ſorts of inferior ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</note>requireth, that we ſhould briefly ſpeake of ſome infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior magiſtrates, that haue authority to puniſh offences of leſſe qualitie, and moment, eyther in regarde of the meanes of the faulte it ſelfe, or the ſlender regard &amp; quality of the perſon that commiteth the ſame. Theſe alſo are of two ſortes, the one hath power of life and death, the other not, their authority ſtretching no farther then to the puniſhment of Rogues and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, whome they cauſe to bee impriſoned or whipt with rods, euery of them according to the proportion of their committed lewdnes. The firſt magiſtrate alſo that hath power to giue ſentence of life and death, is likewiſe deuided into two ſortes. For the ſelfe ſame Iudges doe not ſearch out and examine and call to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the offendor, but the firſt being the heades of the officers by night doe throughly examine the cauſe of <note place="margin">Officers of night.</note>the offender, and regiſter vp in writing the depoſition of the witneſſes, &amp; whatſoeuer elſe the party hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, eyther of his owne accord, or els by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of torture: and then finally repreſent the whole to the iudges of the Properties. This Magiſtrate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Iudges of the properties.</note>much from the former, and giueth ſentence of death, when the cauſe in handling is capitall. But if it be a lighter offence to bee puniſhed onely with whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9073:57"/>
or impriſonment, the captaines of the officers by night, do of themſelues diſpatch the matter without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the aduiſe of the Colledge, eyther for the impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or torturing the offendor, which authority neuer theleſſe the office of the Aduocators hath not, but muſt firſt acquaint the Colledge and proceede according to the decrees thereof, neither is the ſame ſo ordayned without exceeding reaſon and foundation, for that for euery ſmall matter, and the offence of euery baggage fellow, the Councell ſhould haue been mooued, both the common wealthes ſhould haue beene ouermuch troubled with many impertenent brablers, and alſo lewd fellowes ſhould haue had a greater ſcope of liuing licentiouſly, through the hope of eſcaping puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For greater expedition thereof, of theſe kinds of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the heads or chieftaines of the officers by night do obtaine that authority, of which the Aduocators are depriued. Theſe officers of the night are ſix, and ſix likewiſe are thoſe meane officers, that haue onely power to correct baſe vagabonds and tryfeling offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that do execute this office are called heades of the tribes of the city, becauſe out of euery tribe (for the city is deuided into ſix tribes) there is elected an officer of the night, and a head of the tribe, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo we obſerue in the election of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers, as here before I haue expreſſed.</p>
            <p>The duty of eyther of theſe officers is, to keepe a watch euery other night by turn, within their tribes and now the one and then the other, to make rounds about his quarter, till the dawning of the day, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes guarded and attended on with weaponed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:9073:58"/>
and ſerieants, and to ſee that there be not any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order done in the darkenes of the night, which alwaies imboldneth men ill diſpoſed to naughtineſſe, and that there be not any houſes broken vp, nor theeues, nor rogueslurking in corners with intent to do violence.</p>
            <p>At the firſt beginning of the city, eyther of theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices was of great eſtimation: but ſince, new Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates being added, according to the chaunge of the times, and the occaſion of the common wealth: the ſame is much diminiſhed and of leſſer reſpect, for the chiefe authority being tranſferred ouer to the new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, there remaineth onely in their courtes the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of baſe and baggage matters, as the ſuddes or lees of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Hetherto there is inough ſaide of thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that do determine Capitall cauſes: In the next volume we will ſpeake of ciuile Iudgementes.</p>

            <p>But to the end that the whole manner of theſe ciuile iudgements may be made manifeſt and plaine, wee <note place="margin">Two ſorts of Auditors the olde and the new.</note>will begin with the Auditors, which are of two ſortes, that is to ſay, the olde and the new, the olde doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue their name from the antiquitie of their office, <note place="margin">The old Audi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then the new.</note>and being much more ancient then that of the new, which was altogether vnknowne in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, till the ſame beganne to haue Dominion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9073:59"/>
ouer the maine Lande, many ages after the building of the City. Theſe olde Auditors haue in manner the ſame authority in determination of ciuile cauſes, after they are debated of &amp; iudged by the ciuile iudges, as the aduocators haue in all ſuch matters, as any way they ſhall thinke to be offenſiue to the lawes, I meane in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of appeales, or making of report ouer.</p>
            <p>When therefore by the ciuile Iudges, there is any ſentence giuen againſt any man: it is lawfull for him who receiueth preiudice thereby, to appeale from their indgement to the Auditors, the cauſe then being brought into their court, and of eyther ſide pleaded &amp; debated of thoſe betweene whome the controuerſie dependeth, if the ſame exceed not the ſumme of fiftie crowns, they may of their own authority, ſo they agree all in one end and determine the ſame, without the Colledge of the forty: or if they diſagree in opinion, then one of them hath authority to make report ouer <note place="margin">Three Iudges that haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to iudge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on thinges that are found,</note>to a very ſmall Colledge, where the company of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Auditors do note, and likewiſe three other Iudges, that vſually do ſit vpon thinges that are founde: and there theſe leſſer affaires are abſolutely determined.</p>
            <p>But if the whole cauſe did amount aboue the rate of the foreſaid ſumme, before our time the matter coulde not haue beene brought into the Colledge of the Forty, vnleſſe ſomeone of the Auditors had interpoſed himſelfe, and made reporte of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſo giuen by the Iudges, vnto the forty. But in this time of ours there is a Law made, whereby li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is graunted vnto him againſt whome the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iudges haue pronounced ſentence, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9073:59"/>
he may after three monthes (though none of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors intermeddle) call his aduerſary a freſh into <note place="margin">A law lately made, by which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Auditors is greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note>queſtion by appeale vnto the Colledge, by whoſe lawe the authoritie of the Auditors is greatly diminiſhed: yet neuertheleſſe is their report of great auaile to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the cauſe, and beſides the cutting of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of three monthes, ſeemeth to be as a prerogatiue to the Iudges. Preſently vpon the Auditors report the former iudges were before our time ſummoned into the Colledge of the fortie, and there eyther magiſtrate admitted to the maintenance of his cauſe by plea: but now I know not by what negligence by little and little it is brought to paſſe, that the former Iudges, from whoſe ſentences the appeale is brought, doe neyther pleade, nor bee ſo much as preſent at the handling of their cauſe in the Colledge of the forty: onely being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an officer, their anſwere is, that, that which lawe and iuſtice is, may go forward.</p>
            <p>But this cuſtome that the auditors ſhould firſt make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto the colledge of ſuch cauſes as were by appeale brought vnto them, and plead in maintenance of them, hauing continued till our time, is now wholly abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and onely the Aduocates of thoſe between whom the controuerſie reſteth, doe vſe that office, in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſe of their clientes: whereby it is come to paſſe, that this office which was before time ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is now become to bee greatly obſcured and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed. <note place="margin">The iudges of ciuile cauſes obſerue the ſame order in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the criminal iudges.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe fortie Iudges of ciuill cauſes doe in a manner obſerue that order and cuſtome in their iudgementes, as you heard me ſay before is vſually wont to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the forty Iudges of capitall cauſes: onely this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9073:60"/>
there is that in cauſes wherein the life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of any man is called in queſtion, there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne time of ſpeech limited or impoſed, whereas in <note place="margin">A certaine time of ſpeech limited.</note>ciuile controuerſies there is a certaine time appointed, beyond which they may not by any meanes lengthen or extend their plea: that is to ſay, an houre and a halfe onely to each of them that pleadeth: neyther are there in the deciſion of theſe ciuile iudgements many opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alleadged, out of which the Colledge may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiuely chuſe one that ſhalbe beſt to their liking, as in conſultation vpon the puniſhment of malefactors, (I told you aboue is vſually the cuſtome) but it is onely here debated, whether the ſentence giuen by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iudges ſhall be confirmed or abrogated: if any of the Auditors make interceſſion to that ende, then ſhall the queſtion be of abrogating and cancelling the ſame: but otherwiſe if the matter come vnto the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without the interceſſion or addreſſe of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, then the Preſidentes of the Colledge, after the matter is of each ſide throughly pleaded, doe rather propoſe the ſtrengthening and confirming of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iudgement then the diſalowance or cancelling thereof. Preſently all the ſworne Iudges doe prepare <note place="margin">Three ſeuerall pots brought forth, a white, a greene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a redde.</note>themſelues and go vnto their ſuffrages, and three pots likewiſe are brought forth: in the greene the former iudgement is cancelled: in the white it is approued, and in the thirde which is redde, are the balles of thoſe that doe yet remaine doubtfull, and would haue the matter to bee adiourned and deferred. Nothing is helde for abſolute and decreede, vnleſſe more then the halfe doe conclude and agree together in one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, eyther for the ratifying, or diſanulling thereof:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9073:60"/>
of which if the iudges bee not throughly perſwaded, ſo that neyther of both bee decided, the ſame is then deferred ouer till the next day, and the ſame ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againe renewed: and if neyther then it bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, the Colledge is called agayne the thirde day, and the ſelfe ſame proceedinges vſed as before, ſaue onely that after eyther ſide hath ſufficiently plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that they go againe to their ſuffrages, there is no farther reckoning made of thoſe that remayne doubtfull and vnperſwaded, ſo that vnleſſe the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges bee altogether equall, it is determined, and fully ended one way or other, and the former iudgement <note place="margin">Vpon abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment the plaintife hath libertie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>eyther fully confirmed or vtterly abrogated. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe vppon abrogation of the former iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the playntife is not ſo put off and debarred, but that hee hath libertie to renewe his action agayne: for this newe cancelling ſerueth to no other ende, but onely to fruſtrate and make voide and inualide <note place="margin">But vpon the confirmation of the former ſentence the party intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is vtterly debarred.</note>the force of the former iudgement: whereas the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and allowance confirmeth and ratifieth for euer the iudgement that was giuen and pronounced, neyther is there left to the defendant, any place ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of prouocation or appeale, or meane to call the matter in queſtion, vnleſſe there fall out ſome new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or occaſion.</p>
            <p>This ſhall bee ſufficient as concerning the olde Auditors: now wee will briefly ſay ſomewhat of the newe. This Magiſtrate was vnknowen and not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our commonwealth, till ſuch time as the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Empire beganne to imbrace the mayne lande that bordered vppon our Lakes. To theſe may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales be brought from the iudgements &amp; ſentences of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9073:61"/>
               <note place="margin">The New au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors meddle onely with forraigne matters.</note> ſuch gouernors &amp; magiſtrates as without the precinctes of our Citie doe adminiſter iuſtice to people that doe liue vnder our ſubiection: for the olde Auditors were not of themſelues able and ſufficient to vnderſtand and diſpatch both the cauſes of the citie, and thoſe alſo of forrayne places: for which cauſe this Magiſtrate was called by the name of New, in regarde that after the commonwealth was once ſetled and eſtabliſhed, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie began to ſtretch and enlarge her dominion ouer the maine land of the prouince of <hi>Venetia,</hi> which as though it had neuer beene ſeperated from the ſame, returned willingly with a franke and liberall good will. For as I ſhewed you in the beginning of this worke, the nobleſt ſorte of people that inhabited the countrey of <hi>Venetia,</hi> flying the barbarous crueltie of forraine nations, &amp; the generall deuaſtation of all <hi>Italie,</hi> did get themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe lakes of ours, and then did lay the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Why the City was firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Venetia.</note>of this moſt opulent and flouriſhing citie, calling it by the name of <hi>Venetia,</hi> to leaue thereby a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance vnto their poſteritie, that there in the ſame were ioyntly together aſſembled the chiefe prime and flower of the nobilitie of all the cities of the territories of <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> ſo that in ſhort ſpace, when the rule and empire therof began infinitly to increaſe, one Magiſtrate could not ſerue for the diſpatch both of forraine and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cauſes: and therefore this New Magiſtrate was <note place="margin">The New col ledge of the forty ciuile iudges.</note>ordayned, and likewiſe the New Colledge of the forty: into whoſe courtes are brought the appeales from the indgementes of ſuch forrayne magiſtrates as haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment abroade: where being throughly handled and diſcuſſed, they are finally ended and concluded. The manner and forme of proceeding in this colledge,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9073:61"/>
is ſuch in all points (as before I told you) is obſerued of the olde Auditors, and the councell of the forty ciuill <note place="margin">The councel of fortie for cauſes onely within the citie.</note>Iudges, concerning cauſes within the cittie: onely this is added to the authoritie of the new Auditors, that in any matter brought vnto them by appeale, ſo the ſame exceed not the ſumme of fortie crownes, they may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrule the former iudgement, or abrogate it, or allow it eyther in whole or in part, as ſhal ſeeme beſt vnto them, prouided, that they do all agree in one opinion: which <note place="margin">The cauſes of ſtrangers ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then thoſe of the citizens.</note>courſe was thought fit to be ordayned, to the end that forrayners and ſtrangers (of whome according to the preceptes of many great Philoſophers there is eſpeciall regarde to bee had) ſhould not be moleſted and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred off with long delayes, but quickly come to an ende of their ſuites. This priuiledge the olde Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue not: for they of neceſſity muſt eyther whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow the iudgement, or els vtterly cancell and make voide the ſame, and whereas the new (as I ſaid) may, leauing the reſt, meddle onely with parte of the cauſe, they muſt either embrace the whole entire cauſe, or els vtterly leaue it vnmedled withall. So that by this means theſuites of ſtrangers are ſooner ended &amp; determined, then the cauſes of the citizens, though through the ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telty of Aduocates and Lawyers (who leaue nothing vnattempted, how farre ſoeuer the ſame be from right) proceſſes and ſuites are ſundry times drawen out to an infinite length: as in all places it is vſuall, where iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes are not raſhly pronounced, but leaſurely and conſiderately at appointed times.</p>
            <p>Now (in a manner) haue we expreſſed the whole form which is vſually obſerued in iudgements, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we briefly ſpeak ſomwhat of thoſe magiſtrates
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9073:62"/>
who firſt of all do giue ſentence in cauſes of the Citie, &amp; <note place="margin">Sixe ſeuerall kindes of Iudges.</note>from whom the appeales &amp; prouocations are brought to the old Auditors, and to the councell of the fortie: of theſe Iudges there are ſix ſeueral courts, diuided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie of the cauſes and of the perſons. For eyther the ſuites are about marchandiſe, or matters pertayning thereunto, or about houſes or groundes that are within the Lakes, or about poſſeſſions and landes that are on the Continent, or els about other contractes, or bargaines: as for the perſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they are eyther citizens or ſtrangers, or one with another ſtrangers and citizens together: or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is betweene orphelins, or els moued at the ſuit of the widdowes, for the recouery of their dower after the death of their husbands. Leſt therefore there might fall out a confuſion among iudgements of ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kindes, to the end that the one ſhould not bee a diſturbance or hinderance to the other, there were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeuerall Courtes of iudgement, in ſo much that as farre forth as poſſible it might bee, euery one according to the quality of his buſineſſe might know the proper and peculiar Iudge of his controuerſie: for <note place="margin">Iudges of the properties.</note>whatſoeuer differences ariſe about houſes, groundes, or leaſes, ſituated or lying within the boundes of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> (that is, being within the lakes) are all determined by thoſe that are called Iudges of the properties, to whoſe Courtes alſo widdowes haue recourſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes of their dower, after the death of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes. This name and appellation of properties was firſt giuen them, becauſe our aunceſtors did take thoſe thinges to be properly their owne, which were ſeated within the Lakes, as not being eaſie to bee transferred
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9073:62"/>
to the dominion of other mayſters: as for ſuch goods as they had vpon the Continent, whether they were landes or houſes, in regarde that they lay open to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and might in diſpight of their mayſters ſuffer rapine and ſpoyle, they called by the name of moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables: if then the controuerſie ariſe concerning any poſſeſſion vpon the maine landes, for redreſſe thereof recourſe is to be had to the Iudges of the Procurators: <note place="margin">Iudges of the procurators.</note>vnder whome the matters of Orphelins that are yet vnder gardians are handled, for among the Venetians both gardians and tutors were wont to be called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators. If the contention and ſtrife do any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Merchantes or matter of merchandiſe, then for the deciſion of thoſe cauſes are there certaine peculiar <note place="margin">Iudges or Conſuls of the merchants.</note>Iudges, called properly Iudges or Conſuls of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes. Theſe doe in their Iudgements vſe a ſpeedier diſpatch then any other of the ciuill magiſtrates: which was ſo ordayned, to the ende that marchantes, whoſe affaires might otherwiſe receyue great detriment and hinderance, with lingering and delayes might not bee deluded or entertayned with long expectation of their <note place="margin">Iudges of ſtrangers.</note>right. But if the queſtion bee betweene ſtraungers, or that if any citizen will ſue a ſtranger that commeth to lodge in <hi>Venice</hi> for ſome fewe dayes, thoſe Iudges muſt then bee repayred vnto that are appoynted to heare the cauſes of ſtraungers, and haue thereof their proper nomination and tytle. But all other cauſes of ſales, bargaines, or contractes, by which any citizen pretendeth eyther breach of couenant or dueneſſe <note place="margin">Iudges of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes.</note>of debt, are referred to the Iudges of requeſtes, who ſerue in ſteade of the Mayor or Pretor of the Citie.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9073:63"/>
There are beſides certaine ſmall thinges, whoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Iudges of the moueables.</note>and determination is committed to certaine offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that are called Iudges of the moueables. Likewiſe there is another kinde of magiſtrate, whoſe office is, if any thing happen to bee founde, that had layne long hidden, or els beene lately loſt, to iudge and determine <note place="margin">Iudges of things that are found.</note>whether the ſame ought to belong to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or to any priuate man, or els to him whoſe chaunce it is to find it, all things of the like kind and nature being vnder the compaſſe of his authoritie and iudgement.</p>
            <p>Hauing expreſſed the ſeuerall kinds and manners of <note place="margin">Magiſtrates that haue charge of common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note>iudgements, we wil now paſſe ouer to thoſe magiſtrates that haue charge ouer the common chamber or treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the receipt &amp; employment of the publike reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new. Theſe perchance may ſeeme to ſome body more in number then is conuenient, and that a few might as ſufficiently diſcharge the whole buſineſſe pertaining to the treaſure: but here they muſt marke, that our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers omitted no kinde of heedfulneſſe to preuent all fraude &amp; deceipt in the adminiſtration of their publike treaſure, ſuppoſing the ſame to bee the very fountayne whence the other parts of the commonwealth receiue their nouriture and ſuſtenance, and likewiſe grow to an exceeding weakeneſſe and empoueriſhment by the drying vp and decay therof, in ſo much that they made a ſolemn decree, that what citizen ſoeuer ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted of hauing abuſed or defrauded the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhold be to al poſterity defamed with a perpetuall note of diſhonor: and the ſame perpetualy euery yeare ſhould to his eternal ſhame be renued. For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certain appointed day the great councel is ſolemnly aſſembled,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9073:63"/>
and there in a publike oration made by one of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators, all ſuch as haue beene conuicted of this crime as named with titles of reproach, to the end that the ſhame and infamie of ſo foule a fact may neuer growe out of date or be forgotten.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates who haue charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are of two ſortes.</note> But returning to the purpoſe: The magiſtrates who haue charge ouer the Treaſure are of two ſortes, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the treaſure it ſelfe, for eyther it conſiſteth of the publike rentes, reuenewes, and tributes, or elſe when great and important occaſions ſhal ſo require the ſame, is raiſed of taxes and ſubſidies that are leuied according to the abilitie of the citizens: which oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when warres with which our city hath been much afflicted, do grow vppon vs eyther by ſea or land, as when the Turke incrochingly aſſaileth our dominions, whoſe mighty puiſſance and formidable attempts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well againſt vs, as againſt the whole commonwealth of Chriſtendome, wee alone not without exceeding charge and detriment haue reſiſted and kept at a baye many yeares, or elſe when chriſtian princes not broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the greatnes of the Venetian empire, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt the ſame, as in the fifteenth yeare before this, in manner all the greateſt princes of chriſtendome were ſtrongly linked, leagued and confederated againſt vs: but God be thanked: their endeuours were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, and our affaires though for a while declining, were yet at length reſtored into their former eſtate &amp; flouriſhing erected grearneſſe.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that this common treaſure conſiſteth of two kindes, two likewiſe are the kinds of magiſtrates to whoſe charge they are committed. The one for the ſubſidies leuied of the people: and the other for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9073:64"/>
the common rents and tributes: Theſe tributes are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied eyther of goods tranſported out of the City, or els of ſuch as are brought into the ſame: others the like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are collected and gathered out of thoſe other citties that are vnder the Venetian dominion. The tributes Tolles, and cuſtomes of the citie, aſwell through the great aboundance of marchandize, and infinite aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of marchants, as alſo the innumerable multitude of people that dwell within the ſame, are farre greater then a man would imagine, and as the kinds of theſe matters &amp; marchandize are diuers, ſo likewiſe are the officers ouer them inſtituted &amp; ordained, as it beſt ſeemed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whoſe ſupremecharge &amp; ſuperintendance they belong to acquaint you with the particularities &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar offices of euery one of which would rather breed a vaine and weriſome tediouſnes, then any neceſſarie or pleaſing delight, for which cauſe I thought it not amiſſe to ouerſlippe thoſe magiſtrates, whoſe offices are not of continuance, but are onely inſtituted vppon occaſions. In ſumme the chiefeſt point belonging to all theſe officers is to be heedefull that no parte of this commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treaſure be embezeled, miſemployed or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly regarded, all controuerſies likewiſe ariſing about this money, are by them iudged and determined, ſo ſoo e as they haue gathered in their mony, they carie <note place="margin">The Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

happeneth neuertheleſſe very ſeldome, for commonly, or rather alwaies, vnleſſe extreame occaſion require the contrarie, the Senate (as their chiefeſt care is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the generall good of the commonwealth:) ſo alſo haue they a moſt eſpeciall and ſingular regarde of the particular eſtate of the citizens.</p>
            <p>The ſumme that is to be leuied being determined, &amp; time appointed for the payment thereof; euery one bringeth in as much thereof, as he was rated at, which is exacted and gathered in, by the gouernors of the rentes, and by them brought to the Treaſurers of the Chamber.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9073:65"/>
reaſonable, that ſomewhat ſhould bee againe reſtored vnto them out of the common reuenew, that had in the neceſſarie times of the common wealth, ſpent and empayred their ſubſtance: for as the partes ought to haue regarde to the ſafety of the whole, ſo in naturall reaſon alſo ought the whole to defend and preſerue the partes, in aſmuch as may bee from all inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wrong, and to participate with them ſome part of the common nouriture, thereby to reſtore &amp; enharten them, but in our time this debt of leuied mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was ſo exceſſiue and great, that the very intereſt thereof, after the rate I ſpake of, amounted to three hundred thouſande Crownes by the yeare, which payment being of late, by reaſon of the extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and dangerous warres, wherewith the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was enuironed, withholden, and kept backe, now finally, ſome foure yeare ſince, there was a ſtatute and decree enacted by the Senate, (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and perſwaders thereof being <hi>Dominico Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſano,</hi>

            <p>Now then to turne our ſpeech thether againe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we digreſſed. The Preſidentes of the lones are thoſe that do gather together the money wherein the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are taxed at ſuch times as the commonwelth nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their helpe, of which when in their bookes they haue taken a particular note and reckoning, then finally they deliuer the ſame ouer to the Treaſurer of the Chamber of the Citty, from whome it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to their charge to exact ſuch ſummes of money, as were yearely accuſtomed to be yeelded in ſteade of rent to the priuate Cittizens: and likewiſe to regiſter vp in their bookes both the receipt and expence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But this money which by the Senates decree is leuied of the Cittizens, and is after a certaine time to bee reſtored vnto them againe, was wont both
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9073:66"/>
to bee collected and repayed by a certaine peculiar Magiſtrate thereunto appointed: Now this office <note place="margin">Officers that do ſeaze and ſell the goods of thoſe that do not at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pay the mony in which they are taxed.</note>belongeth wholy to the Gouernours of the Rentes. There is alſo an other money-Magiſtrate not to bee omitted, to whoſe office it appertaineth to ſearch, ſeaze, and to ſell openly the goodes of ſuch as do not at the time appointed pay the ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at which they are taxed. There are alſo other money-Magiſtrates, that do ſeeke out the endebted Cittizens, and do aſwell peruſe the bookes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of priuate men, as alſo thoſe of the common welth, to the end that the treaſurie and common welth may not any way bee defrauded, which for auoiding tediouſneſſe I will ouerpaſſe, becauſe they are not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moment, to that order and gouernement of our common wealth which I haue taken vpon mee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Preſidents o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the coyne or mintmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> Beſides theſe heretofore mentioned, there are alſo certain other magiſtrates, whoſe offices are of greate auaile, to the commoditie, quietneſſe, honour, health, and happineſſe of our Countrie, and therefore not to be ouerſlipped in ſilence. Firſt are the maiſters of the coyne aſwell golde, as ſiluer, the currant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of which as yet entertaineth the willing trafique of ſtraungers: ſo is it comfortable and commodious to the Citizens within themſelues: then the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters, and health maiſters of <hi>Venice,</hi> both being <note place="margin">Corn maſters. Helth maſters. Preſidentes of the Arſenall.</note>of great and exceeding conſequence, as likewiſe are the worſhipfull Preſidentes of the Arſenall. Then are there certaine officers, ſuch as among the Romains <note place="margin">Aediles.</note>were called <hi>Aediles,</hi> to whoſe care belongeth the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9073:67"/>
mending and repayring of the ſtreetes and Bridges, and other the like matters of that kinde and office, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinglie requiſite and neceſſarie in this common wealth of ours, and laſtly the office of thoſe whome <note place="margin">Procurators.</note>the Venetians call procurators, being of great dignity and ſingularly auailable to the City.</p>
            <p>Of the Preſidents of the money or Mintmaiſters I knowe not what I ſhould ſay more, then that their chiefe charge and care is, that the gold and ſiluer be not coyned in any baſer allay, then that which by the law is appointed, neither that the ſame beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit leſſe weight then it ſhould doe: which hath beene of vs all moſt religiouſly obſerued, inſomuch that the money of <hi>Venice</hi> is of great account, and runneth currant aſwell among the barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it doth in Chriſtendome. For whereas all other Chriſtian Princes in a manner, cauſe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be ſtamped in a baſer allay, to the end to make it ſtretch the farther: ours haue alwayes herein moſt conſtantlie retayned that dignitie which they recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their aunceſters.</p>
            <p>The magiſtrate that hath the charge for the prouiſion of corne is exceedingly neceſſarie to this city of <hi>Venice,</hi> becauſe there being but a ſmall quantitie of corne to be gathered out of the territorie of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the cittie being moſt populous, and round about encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with lakes, of neceſſitie there is greate care to bee had of theſe prouiſions: leaſt the people whoſe benefit and commoditie was ſo exceedingly of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters reſpected through dearth and ſcarſity of corne, might fall into the extremitie of Famine. There
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9073:67"/>
are therefore appointed three mayſters or ouerſeers of this matter of corne, whoſe Magiſtracie endureth ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene monthes: their office &amp; charge is carefully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that the Citie bee neuer at any time afflicted with the ſcarcitie of corne, of which if at any time they ſtand in doubt, they preſently repaire vnto the Duke, and to the Colledge of the Sages, and there the matter being well debated, doe at length determine what courſe is therein beſt to be taken. Sometimes there is a certaine rewarde and recompence out of the common treaſure appointed to thoſe that ſhall from farre countries tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any corne to <hi>Venice.</hi> Sometimes they bargayne with merchantes for the vndertaking to bring by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne time ſuch quantity of corne as they ſhall agree vpon to <hi>Venice,</hi> from out of forraigne regions, and for the ſame to be payed out of the publike treaſure, which promiſe vnleſſe the marchantes faithfully performe, they are by the ſenate amerced in a great ſumme of money. And whereas the commonwealth buyeth this corne deerely and at a great rate: it ſelleth the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the common people very good cheape, and at a ſmall price, ſuffring ſometimes therein a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loſſe.</p>
            <p>There are beſides this many other excellent lawes and decrees concerning this matter of corne, which if I ſhould perticularly rehearſe, I ſhould digreſſe farther from my purpoſe then were fit.</p>
            <p>Now followeth that Magiſtrate to whoſe prouidence and care all ſuch thinges as tend to the health and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe of the citie do appertain. His chiefeſt office is to foreſee, that there come not into the citie any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious infection, which if at any time it happen to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9073:68"/>
creepe in (as ſometimes it chanceth) then to take ſuch diligent and carefull order, that in as much as may bee the ſame come not to ſpreade any further. To which ende there are certaine goodly commodious houſes built in the lakes three miles off from the citie, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning neer vnto them there are gardens of great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, into which houſes if any of the people fall ſicke, he is preſently conueyed with his whole familie: and thoſe that haue had any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation with him that is ſo fallen ſicke, to the end they infect not others, muſt alſo (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their owne manſions) be remoued to other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique houſes built to the ſame vſe, but in a part without the citie quite contrarie to the other, where they are conſtrained to remaine the ſpace of fortie daies: if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time they continue ſound and well, then they are ſuffred to returne to the citie and to their dwelling places. There is alſo a great care had of their houſholde ſtuffe, leaſt by the contagion thereof, any one ſhould get infection. This Magiſtrate likewiſe hath a care that there bee not any ſtinking or rotten meate, or any other vnholeſome thing ſolde, that might any way offend or bee noyſome to the health of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Finally his onely care is to preuent infection and ſickneſſe, and to preſerue pureneſſe and health within the citie: This office was inſtituted not long before our time; whereas before the cittie was ſundry times ſo mortally afflicted with the plague, that whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies flying the infection thereof, leauing their proper habitations, forſooke the towne, &amp; went to the next countries vpon firme lande. But ſince the creation of this new magiſtrate (Gods goodneſſe be thanked) there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9073:68"/>
hath not beene (in a manner) any peſtilence at all: though ſometimes (as in ſuch a maruellous concourſe of people out of all partes can hardly bee auoided) ſome houſes haue beene infected: but by the diligence of this magiſtrate, and eſpecially Gods fauour aſſiſting him therein: the diſeaſe hath not taken roote, nor been ſuffred to ſpread it ſelfe abroade.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and manner of the Arſenall.</note> Now we come to ſpeake of the honourable gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Arſenall: the ſame being a ſingular orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely to <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelfe, but generally (ſuch is the ſtatelineſſe and glorie thereof) an honour and dignitie to all <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe it is a matter of infinite magnificence and maieſtie, and worthy of all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>The Arſenall is built on that ſide of the citie, which of all others is neereſt to the maine ſea, hollowed out into three boſomes, or to ſpeake more properly, into three diuided entries, into euerie of which the ſea en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth by one onely gate, the ſame being ſo large, that it is capable of the greateſt Gallies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This gate is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified on each ſide with two ſtrong Towers, which are ioyned together with a mightie drawbridge, and a huge perculliſſe, which are neuer opened but vpon the occaſion of letting Gallies out or in. There is no other paſſage to go into the inner partes of the Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but onely by this gate. The firſt boſome or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie within the ſame, though it be the leaſt of the three, yet notwithſtanding it is very great and ſpacious: being roofed, couered and tyled round about on euery ſide in manner of certain vaults, vnder which the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that are come from ſea do repoſe til new ocaſion fall out of employing them ſafe &amp; free from the annoyance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:9073:69"/>
eyther of wind or weather, ſo that they continue many yeares ſound and good: likewiſe vnder theſe vaultes doe they build their new Gallies, and mende and make vp their old: a worke ſurely of great goodlineſſe and glory, and moſt fitte and commodious for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a nauie. Next this boſome or gully there is an inwarder maruellouſly great and large, ordered round of euery ſide with ſuch vaultes as I ſpake of: of which vaultes you ſhall not ſee any one emptie: but in thoſe that are wide two Gallies, and in the narrower one at leaſt.</p>
            <p>The third, being not much inferior to the ſecond in largeneſſe, was but a little before our time added to the two former, and is compaſſed about with goodly wals, and builded with many vaults, which though they bee not all as yet finiſhed: yet dayly they are diligently in hande, about the ending and accompliſhing thereof. There is onely one way by which men go from one to the other: and on the outſide they are compaſſed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with one wall, diſtinguiſhed here and there with certaine towers, in the which there are nightly watches kept to preuent the daunger of fire, the treachery of any ill diſpoſed perſon, or any other caſualtie, whereby ſo goodly and excellent a worke might come to be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or defaced. Within the walles are certaine roomes, repleniſhed with all manner of Nauale inſtruments, &amp; all kindes of artificers thereunto belonging, haue there their workehouſes and ſhops. There great quantities of braſſe are melted for the making of their artillerie: &amp; likewiſe there are alſo made infinite prouiſions of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder: ſo that within the Arſenall there wanteth not any thing which appertayneth to the affaires of the ſea:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9073:69"/>
There you may beholde an infinite number of worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, euery one exerciſing his owne particular trade &amp; office.</p>
            <p>There are beſides theſe certaine great and ample roomes, wherein there is alwaies readie an vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abundance of armour, weapons, and artillerie of all ſorts: likewiſe of ſailes, cables, tacklings, ankers, oares, and ſuch like, euery kinde laide vp ſeperately by it ſelfe. In ſo much that when the ſenate ſhall determine to ſet forth a nauie, all thinges thereunto belonging are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in a moment. All theſe thinges and ſeuerall workes are vnder the authoritie of this Magiſtrate, of which I determined to ſpeake: hee maketh choyce as well of the Carpenters, as of the ſmithes and tryers of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and all other kindes of workemen belonging to the buſineſſe of the ſea, hauing care that each of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his buſineſſe with diligence: for the payment of all which Nauale workes and other charges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, there is mony deliuered vnto him out of the common treaſure. The Colledges allowance being therein firſt demanded, and they made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his reckonings. This magiſtrate, in the time of our aunceſtors was of ſingular reputation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but in theſe times of ours the ſame is much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed and of leſſe eſtimation.

Now laſt of all wee are to ſpeake of the Procurators <note place="margin">The procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Saint Marke.</note>of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> being of all the other magiſtrates the greateſt and moſt honourable next vnto the Duke. For their time of authoritie is not limited, but continueth during life. To this honour is alſo adioyned the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall dignitie and place of a Senator: and equall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ſuffrages with the lawful Senators: and this they haue beſides aboue all other magiſtrates, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the elder citizens doe not giue any preheminence of place to the other, but onely in certaine courtes the honour thereof is alwayes and in euerie place yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Procurators: for in what Court or place ſoeuer they ſitte, they are euer alike honoured with the higheſt place, as though they did in euerie place performe the office of the magiſtrate there preſiding. Their office is to take vpon them the defence &amp; tutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of Orphelins, who being vnder age, and their fathers deade without making any will, haue not any tutor or ouerſeer appointed them: for which cauſe this charge and office is neuer giuen to any, but to ſuch as are throughly knowne to be of ſingular good conſcience and integritie of life, and haue paſſed (in a manner) through all the other offices of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without any touch of diſhonour, and a generall approbation of an vncorrupted vertue: and ſo at length after their long ſeruice to the commonwealth, doe obtayne therein this great and principall dignity, which continueth with them during their liues.</p>
            <p>In times paſſed this office was of paſſing great and honourable eſtimation, not onely within <hi>Venice,</hi> but alſo in forrayne regions, in ſo much that not onely the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9073:70"/>
ſubiectes and neere borderers, but alſo forreners and ſtrangers, made them by teſtament their executors, and put wholly into their hands the adminiſtration of their goodes, during the minority of their children. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe great ſummes of money are committed to them, to bee by their diſcretion diſpenſed and beſtowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poore, ſo that in theſe times of ours great and mighty ſummes of money are committed to their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, as well to the vſe of Orphelins, and the poore, as otherwiſe. This office was at the firſt inſtituted, to the ende that the heritages and ſubſtances of thoſe citizens that ſhould eyther die in ſeruice of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or in traficke of marchandiſe among forraine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhoulde not bee by fraude miſemployed or diuerted from their heires. This charge &amp; confidence therefore is eſpecially giuen to thoſe, whoſe conſcience, behauiour, and conuerſation, a long approouedexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath allowed for excellent, &amp; without exception.</p>

               <note place="margin">The addition of new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators from time to time.</note> At the firſt beginning they were onely three that did exerciſe this office. Afterwarde vpon the increaſe of the citties greatneſſe, three more were added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but their authoritie ſo diuided, that the old ſhoulde ſtill retayne the charge of thoſe pupilles and Orphelins which are on the farther ſide of the channel that runneth through the middle of the Citie, and the new to haue the gouernment &amp; looking to of thoſe that are on this ſide, halfe of the city belonging to the charge of the former three, and halfe to that of the later three. Beſides theſe there are other three that are (as it were) patrons of the royal, ſumptuous, and magnificent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> vnder the protection of which bleſſed &amp; holy Euangeliſt the commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi>

Theſe three Procurators haue charge conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to looke to the maintayning of this goodly Temple, and amending the decayes thereof, as alſo to the prieſts, to the end that diuine ſeruice may therein be ſaid, according to the dignitie of our city, &amp; the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our bleſſed patrone &amp; aduocate <hi>S.

The carefull vſage of the mint is a matter not lightly to bee eſteemed, becauſe nothing ſtrengtheneth more the trafick &amp; trading of a citie, then the purity &amp; goodnes of the mony: neyther is the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouiſion of corne a matter of light regard: likewiſe the prouiding for the health of the citizens, &amp; the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of wayes, bridges and common buildinges are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſingular auaile, fitneſſe and neceſſitie.

The fourth magiſtrate of authority in euery principall Cittie, is the Liuetenant of the Caſtles, in ſome places there is but one, and in ſome more, they command ouer thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that are in garriſon of the Caſtles, and haue the charge of ſuch weapons, victuall, artillery, and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as are within the Caſtle: yet the Lieutenant hath not ſo abſolute authority within the Caſtle, but that he is alwaies ſubiect to the commandement of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall, to whoſe authority and power all things of that kinde are wholy attributed: but in leſſer citties or townes there is no captaine generall: all thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there vnder commandement of the Gouernour. Likewiſe in ſuch townes as are within the precinctes of greater citties, the Gouernour onely adminiſtreth right to the townſmen, and no other magiſtrate, though the Treaſurers &amp; captains haue alſo authority through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Territory of the chiefe Citties, from all theſe Gouernours appeale may be brought to the new Auditors, ſometimes alſo the Aduocators were wont to ſit with the Gouernours vpon ſentences of life and death: but becauſe thereby iudgements were oftentimes delayde, and lewd perſons in the meane time not puniſhed, there was a lawe made by the colledge of the ten, that the Aduocators ſhould not haue any farther authority in ſuch iudgements as were

            <p>But ſeeing there is aſwell a reckoning to bee made of managing warres, as of maintaining peace, which whoſoeuer wholy do reiect, cannot as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth in his Polytiques, long defend and maintaine themſelues in freedome and libertie: But thoſe that haue left vnto their poſterity the true directions of a commonwealth, commended the vſe of both, to the end that in times of warre, they ſhould not bee vnfit for the exerciſes thereof, and that in peace they might liue in honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes vnder the lawes and ſtatutes of their Country, ſo that alwaies the vertue and exerciſes of warre haue a reference to the ſtudyes of peace, as being of the two the moſt excellent and deſirable, for ſuch is the verie force, working, and operation of nature it ſelfe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, that firſt it ſhould couet and ſeeke, that which is to it ſelfe conueuient, and then reſiſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues from that which is contrarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which in all liuing creatures that are created, with any perfection of nature is eaſie to bee diſcerned: for there is none of them which wanteth a deſire leading him to that which to his nature is moſt agreeable, and likewiſe there is adioyned to the ſame a force and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to be angrie, which <hi>Plato</hi> placeth in the heart, to the end that through the ſtirring therof euery creature might be prone to reſiſt and repell that which is to his nature noyſome and contrarie, the firſt ſeedes then of

eyther of theſe partes being by nature placed in the mindes of men as being of all other creatures the moſt perfect: ought of ciuile men to be embraced, that they may bring forth the fruites of eyther effect, that is, both of warre and peace, which courſe was not neglected of our anceſters, howſoeuer to ſome it ſeeme otherwiſe: for though the citty being builded in the ſea, and at the firſt for many years careles of extending their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rule ouer the continent, did not apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to land wars, yet did they with maruelous glory of ſucceſſe bend themſelues to warres by ſea, atchiuing therewith many notable exploits, aſwell in defence of their owne liberty, as in reuenge of iniuries done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their enemies, and many great and glorious deeds of the Venetians do yet remaine in ancient recorde, &amp; many triumphes and victories wreſted by ſea, from fierce and puiſſant nations, whereby it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of the mightineſſe of the Venetians by ſea in forepaſſed times, but in the end yeelding to the inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t petition of the oppreſſed bordering people, who could not endure the rapines and cruelties of ſeuerall tyrants, that had brought them into ſubiection, they ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the mayneland, and expelling the tyrants, did with an infinite applauſe and willingnes of the people receiue all thoſe Prouinces of their olde conſideration into their protection, as though they had neuer beene diſunited thereby ſetting them free from out the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of inſolent ſtrangers, which being the remainder &amp; ofſpring of thoſe Barbarians, that had wrought that general deuaſtation in <hi>Italy,</hi> had then neſtled themſelues and helde the people in a moſt cruell and miſerable bondage.</p>

This increaſe therfore of dominion being added to the former greatneſſe of the city, their deſire and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour was not onely to comfort and cheriſh this new receiued people with wholeſome and profitable lawes, but alſo to finde out meanes, whereby to maintaine and preſerue their recouered freedome and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but the ſituation of their City being in the ſea, on the other ſide vtterlie diuerted their mindes from wholy applying themſelues to land wars, aſwel through the inconueniency of the City thereunto, as alſo for the auoiding of ciuill diſturbance and tumult, for of neceſſity thoſe citizens: to whoſe lot the managing of theſe ſaide wars ſhould haue befallen, might haue ſpent the greater parte of the yeare vpon firme land, aſwell to ride and practiſe their horſes, as alſo to inure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelues in ſundry manners of skirmiſh, and kinds of fight: and withall for their better skill in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and martiall affaires, it ſhould haue beene neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them, when occaſion of employment wanted at home to frequent forrein warres, thereby aſwell to confirm their courages, as to ſtrengthen their bodies, and ſo to enable themſelues in that function, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of their country, whereas otherwiſe, without this kinde of exerciſe, they would haue beene vntill eyther to command as captaines, or to obey his ſcutchions. But now this their continual frequentation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and diuorcement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were from the ciuile life, would without doubt haue brought forth a kinde of faction different and diſioyned, from the other pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable Citizens, which parcialitie and diuiſion wold in time haue bred ciuile warres and diſſentions within the City, I omit in the meane time to ſpeake of thoſe

The Cittizens therefore of <hi>Venice,</hi> for this only cauſe are depriued of the honors belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to warres by land, and are contented to tranſferre them ouer to ſtraungers: to which ende there was a lawe ſolemnely decreede, that no Gentleman of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> ſhould haue the charge and commaundement of aboue fiue and twentie ſouldiers, though the ſame law hath not beene in theſe times of ours altogether ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued but through the courſe of cuſtome in a manner abrogated, by reaſon of the many and ſundrie warres, wherewith we haue beene encombred, ſo that nowe when wee haue any warres by land, there are ſome of <note place="margin">Legates or proueditors.</note>our Gentlemen ſent into the Armie, who therein doe beare office and authority, while the warre endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as namely, the Treaſurers, and Legates, who neuer ſtirre from the ſide of the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of our Armie, who is alwaies a ſtraunger, which hath no authority to doe or deliberate any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aduice of the Legates. The warre being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eyther Magiſtrate returneth home, giuing vppe his authority, and putting himſelfe into order, and this is wholy the manner of the Venetians warfare by land.

            <p>For in the body of a liuing creature the office of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about, and ſeeing is attributed onely to the eyes, and the other leſſe noble offices, left vnto the other members that are depriued of the vſe of ſeeing, obay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not diſſenting from that which by the eyes they are enformed, but going and bending themſelues thether, whether they are by them directed, and ſo the whole frame of the body is preſerued and maintained in an excellent vnity and agreement, which not vnlike reaſon is the ſupreme rule of thinges in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> committed to the Gentlemen, as to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9073:83"/>
the eyes of the citie, and the vnnobler offices to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both together making a happie and wel compacted bodie: The eyes of the commonwealth, not onely ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelues, but for all the other members, and the other partes of the citie, not ſo much regarding themſelues, as willingly obeying the direction of the eyes, as being the principalleſt partes of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whereas whatſoeuer commonwealth ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelfe to be carried away into that folly and madnes, (as to many it hath happened) that the people will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto it ſelfe the office of ſeeing, &amp; vſurpe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the eyes, neceſſarily the whole commonwealth muſt tumble into a downefall and ruine: And on the other ſide if the gentlemen ſhal onely prouide for their owne good, neglecting that of the other members, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby the people to enuie &amp; indignation, it were impoſſible that it ſhould go wel eyther with the one or the other.

            <p>The firſt of theſe three councels of forty are as you haue heard, the new, for ciuile matters abroad, the ſecond for ciuile matters within, and the third is called the crim inall councell, which is not onely aboue all cauſes criminall both at home and abroade, that are brought vnto it by vertue of appeale, but alſo doth of it ſelf determine many entire cauſes, that are not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any other magiſtrare, the forty are choſen in the great councell, and muſt all paſſe the age of 30. yeares, the other offices any gentleman may attaine at the age of 25. years: the election is not made all in one day, but in eight ſeuerall dayes, &amp; ſitting in euery of which they chuſe fiue vpon the choice of theſe new forty, they are ſtraight admitted into the new ciuile councell, and doe enter thence into the old ciuile councell, and they of the old ciuile preſentlie into the criminal, as you heard before, ſo that paſſing 8. moneths, in either their whole time of authority is 2. yeares, there are ouer euery of theſe, 43. heades, and two vnder heades, which authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they hold onely two moneth s a peece, the heads of the laſt forty which are the criminall Iudges, are they that do ioyn with the Duke &amp; councellors, &amp; with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do repreſent the perſon of the Venetian gouernment. Theſe heads &amp; vnderheads are all elected by lot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:9073:91"/>
There are alſo in the great Councell, three manner of Magiſtrates created, that do bring in and propound cauſes, euery one to the forty appointed him, the firſt are the three Aduocators of the common which doe bring in the cauſes to the Criminall forty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond are the three old Auditors that doe bring in the home ciuile cauſes, to the old ciuile Forty.</p>
            <p>The thirde are the three new Auditors that do bring all forrein ciuile cauſes, into the new ciuile Forty.</p>
            <p>The Aduocators of the common, is a dignity of great account, and neuer graunted but to men of greate yeares, wiſedome, and experience, his chiefeſt charge is to ſee the lawe ſtrictly obſerued, and therefore in iudgement he is alwaies againſt the offender.</p>
            <p>There are alſo many that are Aduocators, whoſe office is to pleade in cauſes, eyther of accuſing or defendiug, accordingly, as they are eyther by the plaintife or defendant, entertained: it is not of neceſſity requiſit that they be Doctors of law, or that they haue therein much ſtudyed, onely that they be skilfull in the ſtatutes, &amp; ordenances of the commonwealth, they muſt all be gentlemen, for there is an ancient law, that none may plead before the magiſtrate, vnleſſe he bee a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: and therefore there are in the great Councell choſen 24. Aduocators, 20. for the offices of the palays, and 4. for the Ryalto: of which euery one that goeth to law, is bound to entertayn one, and to pay him a certain fee, and he likewiſe is bound to defend his cauſe, who entertaineth him, the place where they plead, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what high, &amp; they haue at their feet the notary of the 40 with ſuch writings as they mean to produce, &amp; diuerſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9073:91"/>
times amid their pleading they command him to reade now one Chapter, now one writing, and then another, as the cauſe requireth. The time that eyther partie is allowed for ſpeech is an hower and a halfe, beſides the time that is ſpent in reading the writinges: in ſo much that when the Aduocate ſpeaketh, there is an houre glaſſe helde vpright, and when the writinges are read, the ſame is turned vpon one ſide, to the ende the ſand ſhoulde not fall through, and then is turned vpright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when he beginneth to ſpeake. When eyther part hath alleadged his reaſons, &amp; that ſentence is to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the youngeſt of the fortie cauſeth euery of the Iudges to ſweare that he will giue that ſentence, which in his conſcience he ſhall thinke to be iuſt, &amp; then they go to their ſuffrages, in manner as you may ſee in the former treatiſe.</p>
            <p>All cauſes that are brought vnto the Aduocators are regiſtred vp by their ſecretarie, one firſt, the other next, &amp; ſo forth, in order as they come, and looke in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are regiſtred, in the ſame are they by them brought in, and propounded to the fortie, except it be ſome, which though they come laſt, yet they are ſtill firſt diſpatched, as the caſe of priſoners, of burialles, of medicines, of corne, of rewardes, of Orphlins, of neere kindred, as if the brother ſhould pleade with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the father with his ſonne: theſe cauſes are alway firſt heard, and likewiſe all ſuch as any way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the office or adminiſtration of the Procurators.</p>
            <p>The dominion of the Venetians is diuided into two partes, the one by ſea, the other by land, out of eyther of which they receyue a great yearely in-come. Of the two they account the firme lande reuenewe to bee the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9073:92"/>
greater, eſpecially their poſſeſſions in <hi>Lombardie</hi> are maruellous rich and auayleable vnto them: where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other townes, caſtels, and villages, they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe ſeuen faire cities, as <hi>Treuigi, Padoua, Vicenza, Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Breſcia, Bergamo,</hi> and <hi>Crema.</hi> By ſea they are Lords of <hi>Cypres, Candia, Corfu,</hi> and many other Iſlandes. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the coaſtes alſo of <hi>Sclauonia, Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Hiſtria,</hi> they poſſeſſe many goodly Cities and caſtelles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe the rents of their owne citie, their cuſtomes and tolles by ſea, and their ordinarie yearely taxation or rather (as they call it) tribute of the inhabitantes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to an exceſſiue ſumme: in ſo much that their reuenews one way or other is knowne to beat the leaſt 1200000. Duckets by the yeare: their charges &amp; yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions of disburſtment are likewiſe very great, for alwaies they do entertain in honorable ſort, with great prouiſion a Captaine generall, who alwaies is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger borne: he that now enioyeth that place is one <hi>Iohn Baptiſta de Monte</hi> a Florentine borne, a notable ſoldier, and a very honourable Gentleman, one vnder whome I haue ſerued in the warres, and am in all thankefulneſſe to acknowledge many fauors that I receiued both from him and his brother <hi>Camillo de Monte.</hi> Beſides they do continually entertayne in pay a thouſand men at armes, and a great number of footemen, ſufficient to keepe and defend thoſe places, in the which they keep gariſons alway, as well in times of warre, as of peace: they giue likewiſe great penſions to many gentlemen and Captaines, whoſe ſeruice they vſe when neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. The moſt part of their land forces they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> where by reaſon of the aboundance of victuailes they may liue commodiouſly, and when
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9073:92"/>
time of warre ſo requireth, they ſend them thence whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall thinke good. They alſo keepe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tenne or twelue armed Gallies of warre, which are diſtributed in <hi>Cypres, Candia,</hi> and <hi>Corfu,</hi> and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious places. In euery Galley they haue 150. row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for there are 50. benches, and vpon euerie bench three rowers, beſides euery one contayneth betweene 80. and 100. ſoldiers to fight. The charges of euery Galley one way or other amount to 700. duckettes a month, likewiſe their prouiſions of warre and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of and concerning their Arſenall are of an infinite and exceſſiue expence.</p>
            <p>They haue alwaies armour in the Arſenall to arme ten thouſand men, and in the armory of the Dukes pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to arme 1500. againſt whatſoeuer ſodaine inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience might happen, beſides an innumerable quantity of munition pertaining to the ſea, and artillery of all ſort in maruellous proportion. In times of warre and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie they do ſometimes propoſe great offices and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to ſale for a certaine ſumme of money: for which when ſundry offer the ſumme propoſed, yet none is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected vnleſſe he ouercome his competitors and riuals by ſuffrage, ſo that commonly not withſtanding the ſale thereof, yet the ſame neuer falleth vpon any but vpon the wiſeſt and moſt ſufficient men.</p>

The Cantons of <hi>Venice</hi> did before the inhabitation of the lakes, vnder that name embrace a great circuite vppon the mayne lande, as all <hi>Marca Treuigiana,</hi> and the greater part of <hi>Foro Iulio:</hi> but now onely the Iles, &amp; inhabited places within the lakes

do retaine and peculiarly challenge to themſelues the name of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſituation thereof is ſo ſtrange and ſingular in it ſelfe, that it brooketh no compariſon or reſemblance with any other Citie, eyther of this preſent or former ages: the manner wherof is this. There is a long banke that encompaſſeth the vtmoſt Gulfe of the Adriatique ſea: within the inner parte whereof are certaine great mariſhes or fennes, occaſioned partly by the deſcent of the riuers from the maineland, partly by the flowing of the ſea: within theſe were ſundry little townes, built by thoſe that endeuoured to defende themſelues from the furie of the land warres, and laſtly <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature the miſtreſſe and beſt working perfectreſſe of thinges, defendeth them from the violence of the ſea, by the oppoſition of this banke, increaſed with huge heapes of ſand: and yet not altogether without the artifice and trauaile of man, by fortifying againſt the ſea in places needful, with ſtrong paliſadoes and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie peeres or bulwarkes of ſtone. Theſe lakes were in times paſſed vpon their brinkes to the maine land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed and adorned with many great and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cities, as <hi>Aquileia</hi> on the eaſt ſide thereof, ſometimes a famous Colonie of the Romanes: next vnto it <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> then <hi>Vderzo,</hi> then <hi>Altinos,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Triuigi</hi> and <hi>Padoua,</hi> then the <hi>Moncelleſe,</hi> which ſome will needes haue to be that which was called <hi>Acello,</hi> then vpon the bounding and ſhutting vp of the vtmoſt point <hi>Adria</hi> &amp; <hi>Rauenna,</hi> which was in thoſe daies alſo inuironed about with mariſhes and fennes, and cleanſed by certaine ditches, that (as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth) were made for the ſame purpoſe: but whereas in the beginninges of <hi>Auguſtus
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9073:94"/>
Caeſar</hi> the buildings thereof were all of woode.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his ſucceſſors <hi>Tiberius, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane, Valentian,</hi> and <hi>Theodoricke,</hi> enobled it with goodly edifices, of marble and free ſtone, each of them doing ſomewhat, as well in erection of many ſumptuous pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate pallaces, as publique magnificent Temples, for the Gods. And withall they filled and choaked vp thoſe mariſhes, in ſorte that they reduced them to firme ground, ſo that whereas before it was of all ſides enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned about with thoſe waters, it is now diſtant three miles from them.</p>
            <p>Beſides ſundry of leſſe reckoning, there do diſgorge downe into theſe Lakes, ſeuen famous riuers that come deſcending from the Alpes: as <hi>Taliagmento, Liuenza, La Piaue, La Brenta, Bachiglione, Adice</hi> and <hi>Poe:</hi> which two laſt riuers, the <hi>Adice</hi> and the <hi>Poe</hi> haue filled and ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp thoſe parts of the Lakes, into which they fall with ſande, and the like haue ſundry of the other riuers done in many places: but where the induſtrie and trauaile of men hath defended and preuented the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof. For thoſe mariſhes and Lakes, whoſe length in times paſſed little leſſe extended then two hundred miles, are now reduced to the halfe thereof. Their breadth where they are now at largeſt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue twelue mile, whereas in the time of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors it was twice as much, which being a thing that the enemies of the Venetian State could neuer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, though with great endeuour many times they attempted to choke and drie vp thoſe Lakes, time hath by little and little, by the deſcent of thoſe land riuers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it without any forraine violence, in diſpight of all the defences oppoſed by the Venetians.
